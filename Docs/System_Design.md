## System Architecture

System architecture refers to the overall structure and organization of a system, including its components, their relationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution. It provides a high-level view of the system, defining its major components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other and with external systems. System architecture is concerned with the system’s overall design philosophy, the allocation of functionality to different components, and the coordination and integration of those components.

In summary, system design is a more detailed and specific activity focused on designing the internal components and behavior of a system, while system architecture provides a broader perspective and focuses on the overall structure and organization of the system. System architecture sets the foundation for system design by defining the high-level structure and principles that guide the design process.

## What are the system design procedures?
The procedures of system design typically involves the following steps:

- `Requirements Analysis`: Gather and analyze the requirements for the system. This includes understanding the system’s purpose, functionality, performance expectations, constraints, and user needs.
- `System Architecture Design`: Define the high-level structure and organization of the system. Identify the major components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other. Consider factors such as scalability, reliability, and security.
- `Subsystem Design`: Decompose the system into smaller subsystems or modules. Define the interfaces between the subsystems and specify the functionality and behavior of each subsystem.
- `Component Design`: Design the individual components or modules of the system. This involves specifying the internal structure, algorithms, and data structures of each component. Consider factors such as performance, maintainability, and reusability.
- `Data Design`: Design the data structures and databases required by the system. Define the data schema, relationships, and access mechanisms. Consider data storage, retrieval, security, and integrity.
- `Interface Design`: Define the interfaces between the system and external entities, such as users, other systems, or devices. Specify the input formats, output formats, and protocols for communication.
- `Design Validation`: Validate the system design against the requirements to ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are met. Identify and address any design flaws or inconsistencies.
- `Design Documentation`: Create comprehensive documentation that describes the system design, including architecture diagrams, component specifications, data models, interface definitions, and design decisions.
- `Design Review`: Conduct a review of the system design with stakeholders, including developers, testers, and clients. Incorporate feedback and make necessary revisions to the design.
- `Design Implementation`: Translate the system design into actual code or physical components. Follow coding standards and best practices during the implementation process.

It’s important to note that the specific procedure of system design can vary depending on the development methodology, project requirements, and organizational practices. Agile methodologies, for example, may involve iterative and incremental design processes, while traditional waterfall methodologies may follow a more sequential approach.
