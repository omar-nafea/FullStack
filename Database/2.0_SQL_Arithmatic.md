# SQL Operator

## SQL Operators: Arithmetic Operations

This section introduces SQL operators, focusing specifically on arithmetic operators used for mathematical calculations within a database.

### 1\. What are Operators in SQL?

- **Definition**: Operators are special words or characters that allow you to perform various activities or actions on data within a database.
- **Analogy**: Think of them like:
  - Conjunctions or connecting words in a sentence.
  - Operation keys on a calculator (e.g., plus, minus).
- **Why are they needed?**: When querying and manipulating data, you'll often need to transform or compare values for different purposes. SQL operators provide the tools to perform these manipulations.
  - **Examples**: Calculating salary increases, changes to allowances, remaining leave days, or comparing performance targets.

### 2\. Types of Operators (General Overview)

- SQL features various types of operators, each designed for different functions. This video specifically focuses on **Arithmetic Operators**. Other types (not detailed in this video) include comparison, logical, bitwise, etc.

### 3\. Arithmetic Operators: Concept & Symbols

- **Purpose**: Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations and return a numeric result. They function much like arithmetic operators in mathematics.

- **Operand Concept**: An operator typically takes **two operands** (the values or expressions it operates on) and returns a single result.

  - **Example**: `5 + 5`
    - `5` (first operand)
    - `+` (addition operator)
    - `5` (second operand)
    - `10` (result)

- **Common SQL Arithmetic Operators & Symbols**:

  | Operator Name  | Symbol | Function                                | Example    | Result |
  | :------------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- |
  | Addition       | `+`    | Adds two numbers                        | `10 + 15`  | `25`   |
  | Subtraction    | `-`    | Subtracts one number from another       | `10 - 5`   | `5`    |
  | Multiplication | `*`    | Multiplies two numbers                  | `5 * 5`    | `25`   |
  | Division       | `/`    | Divides one number by another           | `10 / 5`   | `2`    |
  | Modulus        | `%`    | Returns the **remainder** of a division | `100 % 10` | `0`    |
  |                |        |                                         | `10 % 3`   | `1`    |

### 4\. How to Use Arithmetic Operators in SQL (Syntax & Examples)

The `SELECT` command is primarily used to demonstrate arithmetic operations in SQL, as it can be used to display calculated results directly.

- **Basic Syntax for direct calculation**:

  ```sql
  SELECT operand1 operator operand2;
  ```

  - A semicolon (`;`) is often used to mark the end of a SQL statement, though it might be optional in some contexts.

- **Examples of individual operations using `SELECT`**:

  - **Addition**:

    ```sql
    SELECT 10 + 15;
    -- Result: 25
    ```

  - **Subtraction**:

    ```sql
    SELECT 20 - 5;
    -- Result: 15
    ```

  - **Multiplication**:

    ```sql
    SELECT 7 * 3;
    -- Result: 21
    ```

  - **Division**:

    ```sql
    SELECT 50 / 10;
    -- Result: 5
    ```

    _Note_: Be aware of integer division vs. floating-point division behavior, which can vary slightly between different SQL databases.

  - **Modulus**:

    ```sql
    SELECT 100 % 10;
    -- Result: 0 (100 divided by 10 is 10 with no remainder)
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT 17 % 5;
    -- Result: 2 (17 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 2)
    ```

### 5\. Practical Applications (Implied Future Use)

- **Future/Practical Uses**:
  - Calculating derived values (e.g., `SELECT salary * 1.05 AS new_salary FROM Employees;` for a 5% raise).
  - Performing aggregations (though often combined with aggregate functions).
  - Filtering data based on calculated values in a `WHERE` clause.

**In summary**: SQL arithmetic operators provide the fundamental tools for performing mathematical calculations directly within your database queries. Understanding their symbols and how to use them with the `SELECT` statement is the first step towards more complex data manipulation and analysis.

## SQL Operators in Use: Applying Arithmetic Operators to Data

This video demonstrates the practical application of SQL arithmetic operators directly on data stored in database tables, moving beyond simple literal calculations.

### 1\. Core Concept: Applying Operators to Columns

- **Purpose**: Instead of just operating on fixed numbers (e.g., `SELECT 10 + 15;`), arithmetic operators in SQL can be applied to **column values** within a table. This allows for dynamic calculations based on the actual data in your database.
- **Benefit**: Enables efficient, bulk calculations across all relevant records, crucial for tasks like salary adjustments, performance metrics, or data analysis.
- **Syntax Integration**: Arithmetic operations are typically performed directly within the `SELECT` clause, on existing column names.

### 2\. Common Arithmetic Operators in Practice (Examples with `Employee` Table)

Let's assume an `Employee` table with columns: `ID`, `Name`, `Salary`.

- **Addition (`+`): Calculating a Bonus**

  - **Goal**: To see what each employee's salary would look like after adding a fixed bonus (e.g., $500).
  - **Concept**: The operator adds a constant value to the existing value in a specified column for every row.
  - **SQL Code**:
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary + 500
    FROM Employee;
    ```
  - **Explanation**: For each row in the `Employee` table, SQL retrieves the `Salary` value and adds 500 to it, displaying the calculated result. The original `Salary` column in the table remains unchanged; this `SELECT` statement only shows a _derived_ result.

- **Subtraction (`-`): Deducting an Amount**

  - **Goal**: To see what each employee's salary would look like after a deduction (e.g., $500).
  - **Concept**: Subtracts a constant value from the existing column value.
  - **SQL Code**:
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary - 500
    FROM Employee;
    ```
  - **Explanation**: Similar to addition, it calculates and displays the `Salary` minus 500 for each employee.

- **Multiplication (`*`): Doubling a Value**

  - **Goal**: To calculate what each employee's salary would be if it were doubled.
  - **Concept**: Multiplies the existing column value by a constant.
  - **SQL Code**:
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary * 2
    FROM Employee;
    ```
  - **Explanation**: Retrieves `Salary` and multiplies it by 2 for each row.

- **Division (`/`): Determining Monthly Salary**

  - **Goal**: To determine the monthly salary of each employee from their annual salary.
  - **Concept**: Divides the existing column value by a constant.
  - **SQL Code**:
    ```sql
    SELECT Salary / 12
    FROM Employee;
    ```
  - **Explanation**: Divides each employee's `Salary` (annual) by 12 to show the monthly equivalent. Be mindful of data type handling for division (e.g., integer division vs. floating-point results) which can vary by DBMS.

- **Modulus (`%`): Checking Even/Odd IDs**

  - **Goal**: To determine if an employee's ID is an even or odd number.
  - **Concept**: Returns the **remainder** of a division. A remainder of `0` when dividing by `2` indicates an even number; a remainder of `1` indicates an odd number.
  - **SQL Code**:
    ```sql
    SELECT ID % 2
    FROM Employee;
    ```
  - **Explanation**: Divides each `ID` by 2 and displays the remainder. This is a common trick to check for even/odd numbers.

### 3\. Key Concepts for Practical Application

- **`SELECT` Clause Calculations**: All these arithmetic operations are performed within the `SELECT` clause. The database calculates the expression for _each row_ that the `FROM` clause identifies.
- **No Data Modification**: Using arithmetic operators in a `SELECT` statement **does not change the actual data** stored in the database table. It only displays a calculated result in the output (the result set).
  - To _permanently_ change data, you would use the `UPDATE` command, typically with the `SET` clause incorporating these operators (e.g., `UPDATE Employee SET Salary = Salary + 500 WHERE ID = 1;`).
- **Result Set Columns**: The result set of these queries will typically have a column with the calculated values, often with a generic column name. You can use **aliases** (`AS new_column_name`) to give these calculated columns more meaningful headers (e.g., `SELECT Salary + 500 AS Bonus_Salary FROM Employee;`). This was not explicitly shown in the video but is a common practice.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: The power of using operators on columns is that the calculation is performed for every relevant record, automatically and efficiently, without manual computation.

**In summary**: This video demonstrates how SQL arithmetic operators are a powerful tool for performing dynamic calculations on actual database columns using the `SELECT` statement. This allows you to derive new insights and present transformed data without altering the original source information, forming a crucial part of data analysis and reporting in SQL.

## SQL Operators: Comparison Operations

This section introduces SQL comparison operators, which are fundamental for filtering and evaluating data based on relationships between values.

### 1\. What are Comparison Operators in SQL?

- **Definition**: Comparison operators are special symbols or words used to compare two values or expressions.
- **Outcome**: The result of a comparison operation is always a **Boolean value**: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- **Purpose**: They are primarily used in the `WHERE` clause of SQL statements (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) to filter data, including or excluding records based on a specified condition.

### 2\. Common SQL Comparison Operators & Symbols

SQL uses symbols that are familiar from mathematics to represent comparison operations:

| Operator Name            | Symbol(s)    | Function                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal to                 | `=`          | Checks if two values are exactly equal.                                                                                  |
| Less than                | `<`          | Checks if the left operand is less than the right.                                                                       |
| Greater than             | `>`          | Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.                                                                    |
| Less than or Equal to    | `<=`         | Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.                                                           |
| Greater than or Equal to | `>=`         | Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.                                                        |
| Not Equal to             | `<>` or `!=` | Checks if two values are not equal. (Both symbols are common; `<>` is more standard SQL, `!=` is also widely supported). |

### 3\. How to Use Comparison Operators in SQL (Syntax & Practical Examples)

Comparison operators are almost always used within the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement (or `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements) to specify a filtering condition.

- **General Syntax (with `SELECT`):**

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE column_name operator value_or_expression;
  ```

  - `SELECT *`: Retrieves all columns.
  - `FROM table_name`: Specifies the table to query.
  - `WHERE`: Introduces the condition.
  - `column_name`: The column whose values you want to compare.
  - `operator`: The comparison operator (e.g., `=`, `<`, `>=`).
  - `value_or_expression`: The value or another column/expression to compare against.

- **Practical Examples using an `Employee` table (ID, Name, Salary):**

  1.  **Equal to (`=`):**

      - **Goal**: Identify employees with a salary exactly equal to $18,000.
      - **SQL Code**:
        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Salary = 18000;
        ```
      - **Explanation**: The `WHERE` clause filters records where the `Salary` column's value is precisely 18000. If `Salary = 18000` is `TRUE`, the row is included in the result.

  2.  **Less than (`<`):**

      - **Goal**: Find employees earning less than $24,000.
      - **SQL Code**:
        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Salary < 24000;
        ```
      - **Explanation**: Retrieves rows where the `Salary` value is strictly less than 24000.

  3.  **Less than or Equal to (`<=`):**

      - **Goal**: Find employees earning $24,000 or less.
      - **SQL Code**:
        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Salary <= 24000;
        ```
      - **Explanation**: Includes rows where `Salary` is less than _or equal to_ 24000.

  4.  **Greater than or Equal to (`>=`):**

      - **Goal**: Find employees earning $24,000 or more.
      - **SQL Code**:
        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Salary >= 24000;
        ```
      - **Explanation**: Includes rows where `Salary` is greater than _or equal to_ 24000.

  5.  **Not Equal to (`<>` or `!=`):**

      - **Goal**: Find employees whose salary is _not_ $24,000.
      - **SQL Code**:
        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM Employee
        WHERE Salary <> 24000;
        -- Alternatively:
        -- WHERE Salary != 24000;
        ```
      - **Explanation**: Retrieves rows where the `Salary` value is any amount _other than_ 24000.

### 4\. Key Takeaways

- Comparison operators are fundamental for **filtering data** in SQL.
- They evaluate conditions to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- They are most commonly used in the **`WHERE` clause** of `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- Understanding these operators allows you to precisely define which records you want to retrieve or modify.
