# SQL Update and Delete commands

### UPDATE command

The `UPDATE` command in SQL is used to modify existing data in one or more rows of a table. It's crucial for keeping your database information current.

Here's a summary of the necessary information for your revision:

**1. Purpose of `UPDATE`:**

- To change the values of existing columns in rows that match a specified condition.
- It does not add new rows or delete existing ones; it only modifies data within existing rows.

**2. Basic `UPDATE` Statement Syntax:**
The general structure of an `UPDATE` statement is:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

- **`UPDATE table_name`**: Specifies the table in which you want to update data.
- **`SET column1 = new_value1, column2 = new_value2, ...`**:
  - `SET`: Keyword indicating that you are defining the new values.
  - `column = new_value`: For each column you want to change, you specify the column name, an equals sign (`=`), and the new value.
  - Separate multiple `column = new_value` pairs with commas.
  - Non-numeric values (strings, dates) should be enclosed in single quotation marks (e.g., `'new address'`, `'123-456-7890'`).
- **`WHERE condition`**:
  - `WHERE`: Keyword that introduces the condition for which rows to update.
  - `condition`: A logical expression that specifies which rows should be affected by the `UPDATE`. Only rows for which this condition evaluates to `TRUE` will be updated.
  - **CRITICAL WARNING**: If you omit the `WHERE` clause, the `UPDATE` statement will affect _all rows_ in the table. This is rarely desired and can lead to massive data loss or corruption if done accidentally.

**3. Updating a Single Record:**

- **Scenario:** Changing data for a specific, identifiable row (e.g., a student with a unique ID).
- **Method:** Use the `WHERE` clause to target that specific row, typically by its primary key or a unique identifier.
- **Example from Transcript:** Updating the home address and contact number for student with ID 3.
  ```sql
  UPDATE Student_Table
  SET Home_Address = 'New Street Address',
      Contact_Number = '123-456-7890'
  WHERE ID = 3;
  ```

**4. Updating Multiple Records:**

- **Scenario:** Changing data for all rows that share a common characteristic (e.g., all students in a particular department).
- **Method:** Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the common characteristic.
- **Example from Transcript:** Updating the college address for all students in the 'Engineering' department.
  ```sql
  UPDATE Student_Table
  SET College_Address = 'Harper Building'
  WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
  ```

**5. Updating Multiple Columns in Multiple Records:**

- You can combine the concepts. Simply list all the columns you want to update in the `SET` clause, separated by commas, and then use a `WHERE` clause to define the set of rows.
- **Example from Transcript (implied):** Updating `Home_Address` and `Contact_Number` for _all_ engineering students (if that was the intention with the combined example).
  ```sql
  UPDATE Student_Table
  SET College_Address = 'Harper Building',
      Home_Address = 'New Shared Home Address' -- Example of adding another column update
  WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
  ```

**Key Takeaways for Revision:**

- `UPDATE` modifies **existing data** in rows.
- The `SET` clause defines _what_ columns to change and to _what new values_.
- The `WHERE` clause defines _which_ rows to change.
- **ALWAYS** use a `WHERE` clause unless you _intentionally_ want to update every row in the table. Forgetting the `WHERE` clause is a common and potentially catastrophic mistake.
- Separate multiple column-value pairs in the `SET` clause with commas.
- Use single quotes for non-numeric new values.

### DELETE command

The `DELETE` command in SQL is used to remove existing rows (records) from a table. It's crucial for managing the data stored in your database.

Here's a summary of the essential information for your revision:

**1. Purpose of `DELETE`:**

- To remove one or more existing rows from a specified table.
- It only removes rows; it does not remove the table structure itself or the columns.

**2. Basic `DELETE` Statement Syntax:**
The general structure of a `DELETE` statement is:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition; -- This clause is CRITICAL for selective deletion
```

- **`DELETE FROM table_name`**: Specifies the table from which you want to delete rows. The `FROM` keyword is optional in some SQL dialects (like MySQL) but is good practice to include for clarity and compatibility.
- **`WHERE condition`**:
  - `WHERE`: Keyword that introduces the condition for which rows to delete.
  - `condition`: A logical expression that specifies which rows should be affected by the `DELETE`. Only rows for which this condition evaluates to `TRUE` will be deleted.
  - **EXTREMELY CRITICAL WARNING**: If you **omit the `WHERE` clause**, the `DELETE` statement will affect **_all rows_** in the table, effectively emptying it. This is a very common and potentially disastrous mistake if done unintentionally. Always double-check your `DELETE` statements, especially the `WHERE` clause.

**3. Deleting a Single Record:**

- **Scenario**: Removing a specific, identifiable row from a table.
- **Method**: Use the `WHERE` clause to target that precise row, typically by a unique identifier like a primary key, or a specific value in a column that uniquely identifies the row (as in the example).
- **Example from Transcript**: Deleting the record of a student with the last name 'Miller'.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Student_Table
  WHERE Last_Name = 'Miller';
  ```

**4. Deleting Multiple Records:**

- **Scenario**: Removing all rows that share a common characteristic.
- **Method**: Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the common characteristic that defines the group of rows you want to delete.
- **Example from Transcript**: Deleting records for all students in the 'Engineering' department.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Student_Table
  WHERE Department = 'Engineering';
  ```

**5. Deleting All Records from a Table:**

- **Scenario**: Emptying an entire table while keeping its structure intact.
- **Method**: Omit the `WHERE` clause entirely.
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM table_name;
  ```
- **Example from Transcript**: Deleting all records from `Student_Table`.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Student_Table;
  ```
- **Alternative/Consideration**: For very large tables, `TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;` is often a faster and more resource-efficient way to remove all rows, as it typically resets auto-increment counters and reclaims space more aggressively than `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause. However, `TRUNCATE` is DDL (Data Definition Language) and cannot be rolled back in most databases, whereas `DELETE` is DML (Data Manipulation Language) and can usually be rolled back if part of a transaction.

**Key Takeaways for Revision:**

- `DELETE` removes **rows** from a table.
- The `WHERE` clause is **paramount** for selective deletion.
- **Always be cautious** when using `DELETE` statements. Test on a development environment first.
- Forgetting the `WHERE` clause will delete _all_ rows in the table.
