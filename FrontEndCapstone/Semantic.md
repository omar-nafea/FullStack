### The role attribute

The role attribute is another tool you have at your disposal when writing semantic HTML. The role attribute describes the role of an element in a web page. This attribute is global meaning you can use it on any element. While many elements have implicit roles, you can make them explicit by adding a role attribute.

```html
<a href="/book" role="button">Book a table</a>
```
