Hello there! It's great that you're diving into Tailwind CSS. The issue you're facing is a very common one for developers starting with the latest version of Tailwind,
and the solution is straightforward.

The primary reason you're encountering the npm ERR! could not determine executable to run error is that the npx tailwindcss init command, which was standard for older versions (like in the Dave Gray course you're following), is no longer used in Tailwind CSS v4 and later. You have the latest version, v4.1, where the initialization process has been streamlined.

In Tailwind CSS v4, there's no need for a tailwind.config.js file for a minimal setup. The configuration is now handled directly within your CSS file.

One of the main core concept of terrine CSS is utility classes,

Basically with HTML what should we do and using a traditional approach for an element you will first write HTML and from parent to Children you will Target these HTML element with classes then what you will do you will write CSS and this css will be related to your HTML element so you will write one time CSS for one element.

With Tailwind CSS we get the same result way faster with a lighter code base because we are using utility classes.

Utility classes its classes already provided by Tailwind CSS to give the same result but without writing any CSS if you want to use:

- flexbox
- padding
- width
- margin
- background
- color
- border-radius
- ...whatever you just add your classes this way

So you will ask me the question why not to use inline style instead of having those classes well Tailwind CSS has many advantages over inline Style.

First, you have a predefined design system provided by Tailwind which means that from the start if you don't want to create a design system you can easily use the pre-existing design system then with Tailwind in CSS you can focus on responsive design from the start.
