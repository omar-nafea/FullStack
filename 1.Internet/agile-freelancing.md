Where Did Agile Come From?
Much like other paradigm shifts in the business world, agile came into existence based on a business need.

Agile emerged organically as a result of a market need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s. Back in the 1990s, it was taking somewhere in the range of 2-4 years to get a software solution to production from the time it was conceived as a valuable business need. This delay was just not acceptable for enterprise business users. The market had started to evolve and it was beginning to be realized that both the needs and expectations from the business users would not remain static for so long.

A growing number of experts felt that there had to be a better way to build products with a focus on:

business users, and
business value.

History of Agile
In the Spring of 2000, a group of industry experts gathered in Oregon to come up with some common ground on Agile. This meeting lead to a famous gathering in Utah in February 2001 where 17 thought leaders finalized The Agile Manifesto. This historic gathering set the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

Since Agile was developed for software development, many think that software is the only place where Agile is valuable. However, today Agile is being applied in all industries across the globe.

QUIZ QUESTION
TRUE or FALSE: Agile emerged organically as a result of a market need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s because it was taking somewhere in the range of 2-4 years to get a software solution to production from the time it was conceived as a valuable business need.

Key Points
Agile tools are excellent communication and collaboration resources. So, for example, they:

Help monitor the teams’ progress in a transparent and visible manner
Can be customized to accommodate Agile teams in various industries with different Agile frameworks
Provide real-time dashboards and reports that show the Agile team’s progress against the product roadmap

What We Will Cover In This Lesson
In this lesson we will focus on the foundational theory behind Agile. We will discuss:

The Agile Mindset and how it sets the tone for ‘Being’ Agile versus just ‘Doing’ Agile
The Agile Manifesto, and how it is seen as the foundational set of 4 Paired Core Values and 12 Principles that sets the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
How Agile differs from the more traditional Waterfall approach to product development
We will wrap up the lesson with an important discussion on common misconceptions about Agile

By the End of the Lesson You Will Be Able To...
Explain the Agile Mindset and value-driven delivery benefits of Agile
Differentiate between Doing Agile and Being Agile
Explain The Agile Manifesto’s 4 Paired Core Values
Identify and apply the 12 Principles of the Agile Manifesto
Differentiate between Agile and Waterfall approaches


So, why are forward-thinking organizations rapidly adopting Agile? And why are we seeing that global professional bodies such as The Project Management Institute (PMI) in their PMBOK Guide and The International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)’s BABOK Guide, have incorporated and highlighted the importance of Agile in project management, business analysis, and other product delivery activities?

In an increasingly interconnected and competitive global marketplace, I am seeing Agile being leveraged by successful organizations across the globe to thrive in today’s digital age. Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity. Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:


Faster time to market
Early ROI
Feedback from Real Customers
Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile? 
Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity

Note: You are going to learn more about VUCA later in this lesson.

Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile Part 2

Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:
Build the right products
Early risk reduction
Built-in quality
Culture and morale
Efficiency vs. Effectiveness

Efficiency and effectiveness is a fine balancing act that Agile recommends.

If you’re only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency.

If you’re trying to focus on innovation, creativity, and making sure you’re working on the right thing, you need to focus on effectiveness.

This is often done at the cost of efficiency.

Agile ensures a balanced approach whereby Agile Teams ensure there is a balance between speed and creativity.

Agile transformations also benefit from:

Customer Satisfaction
Alignment
Emergent Outcomes
Predictability
Organizations want to use Agile to get there by developing products better, faster, and cheaper.

Agile Is Based on a Systems Thinking Approach and a Growth Mindset
Agilists adopt a practical and realistic approach to delivering the best value, and quality, in the shortest sustainable time.

A Systems Thinking approach, reinforced by a Growth Mindset, helps Agile experts deliver optimal business value.

Systems thinking takes a holistic approach in which the Agile Team looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.

In a growth mindset, individuals on a team have the mindset that their abilities can grow through dedication and hard work.

Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value
Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value

Business Agility
Agile is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals, as teams and as organizations think about, as well as act upon, the work that we do.

Business agility is the ability of an organization to:

Adapt quickly to market changes
Respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense
Adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality
The Agile Mindset
When we talk about an Agile Mindset, we include:

Respect
Collaboration
Continuous Improvement
Iterative Learning Cycles
Mastery and Ownership
Focus on Delivering Value
Adaptability to Change

Doing Agile vs. Being Agile
Some organizations and Agile Teams unfortunately just focus on Doing Agile. This equates to simply adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

Being Agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams, and organizations to unleash their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.

New Terms
Agile Mindset: The set of attitudes supporting an agile working environment
Being Agile: When an Agile team lives & breathes Agile principles and values through Agile practices consistently every day
Business Agility: The ability of an organization to adapt quickly to market changes, respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense, as well as adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality
Doing Agile: When an Agile team adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting Agile principles and values

Gil Broza, The Agile Mind-Set: Making Agile Processes Work, 3P Vantage Media, 2015.
This book clearly articulates how the missing piece in successfully transforming organizations to Agile is the Agile Mindset.

Up until the late 1990’s, majority of product development followed a waterfall style project development life cycle that was based on adhering to strict processes.

The whole product procedure was process centric with the goal of delivering the product successfully rather than focusing on delivering a successful product. This is what lead 17 experts to get together and finalize the Agile Manifesto at a meeting in Utah back in 2001.

The 4 Agile Core Values
These were were developed by 17 industry experts and finalized 2001. They are:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Agile places more importance and emphasis on people and their interactions over processes and even tools.
Working software over comprehensive documentation: Documentation requires a time and resource commitment that might be wasteful.
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Agile promotes a collaborative outlook when product owners work with their customers in reaching an agreement on the details of the product delivery.
Responding to changes over following a plan: Agile embraces the change that makes business sense.
Four Paired Core Values
Four Paired Core Values

The Agile Manifesto Principles
The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set a solid foundation for the various Agile Frameworks that are currently being practiced by successful organizations in today’s digital age.


The 12 Agile Principles
The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values drive the 12 Agile Principles. Let's look at the principles in detail.

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. The goal of product development is the development of successful products.
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. Due to the dynamic competitive landscape, requirements can and will change throughout product development.
Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale. Frequent and iterative delivery of working product provides the business with practical feedback.
Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. The Product Owner and the Agile Team adopt practices that ensure inclusive and joint practices.
Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Agile leaders build Agile teams with skilled resources who are willing to work together collaboratively with a growth mindset.
The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. For a product development team to succeed its members must communicate and collaborate effectively.
Working software is the primary measure of progress. The primary measure of product development should be the delivery of working product increments which meet the evolving needs of the business.
Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. A highly skilled team simply just cannot be expected to successfully develop a product by compelling people to work overtime for extended periods.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. Built-in quality practices have enormous benefits. It allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the product.
Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential. With the guidance of the Product Owner, Agile Teams focus on high value activities, which allows them to focus on the high business value needs.
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. This is a critical principle of the agile world to ensure that emerging and effective architectures, requirements, and designs are built into the product development life cycle to maximize technical excellence.
At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Finding concrete opportunities for improvement is a continual effort.

Common Misconceptions of Agile
Here are 5 of the more common Agile misconceptions that should be avoided keeping the Agile Mindset in focus:

Scheduling Agile ceremonies makes a team Agile - Holding ceremonies for the sake of holding ceremonies does not deliver benefits. Ceremonies must adhere to core principles of Agile.

The Facilitator role is just like a traditional Project Manager - The Facilitator role is different from the Project Manager role. A Facilitator should be a Servant Leader who assists with whatever the team needs to forward.

Large teams are okay - Agile recommends small cross-functional teams that allows the team to be nimble and powerful.

The product backlog can be managed like a traditional requirements document - The backlog should not be a process-driven document, It should focus on customer value and strategic objectives.

Documentation and audit trails for compliance are not important in Agile - Agile does not mean no documentation -- it just removes low value documents and documents what is valuable to maintain and sustain the product.

What We Will Cover In This Lesson
Nice to see you again. This lesson will focus on Agile Frameworks, with the topic being covered as follows:

Introduction to Agile Frameworks in general and what the advantages are of using a framework.
The Scrum Framework and its unique characteristics as a valuable Framework.
The more lightweight Kanban Framework and its unique advantage in managing flow and WIP.
The XP Framework and its advantages, with an appreciation for its more stringent best practices.
By the End of the Lesson You Will Be Able To...
Identify the advantages of using a framework
Identify the specific and shared characteristics of Scrum, Kanban and XP frameworks
Determine which frameworks are appropriate for a given project.
Identify the core team roles assign team members to each role
Implement best practices for each framework, including ceremonies and artifacts

Agile Frameworks Are A Vehicle for Practically Utilizing Agile
Agile's principles related to simplicity, adaptability, and the ability to embrace change attract attention. For Agile to practically be utilized effectively, an Agile Framework, or a combination of frameworks, is usually adopted.

Similarities Between Agile Frameworks:
Adhere to the Agile Mindset as being fundamental to the success of any Agile journey
Emphasize that being Agile is critical to successfully doing Agile
The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks
Provide guidance on how to bring the Agile Manifesto’s core values and principles to life

Agile Frameworks are Enablers that Bring to Fruition the Value of Agile
This includes:

Focusing more on the individuals and interactions; ultimate determining factor for the success of a product are the resources on the Agile product delivery team.
Do not force Agile unnecessarily; Teams that are already performing well can be gradually introduced to additional Agile practices based on a specific Agile Framework.
Refined user stories are important; Agilists work with Product Owners to ensure the user stories have been sufficiently refined for the Agile Team to proceed.
Respect the backlog; Agilists focus on ensuring the Agile Team does not over-commit to what can be accomplished in each iteration, especially during the first few iterations.
Implementing a Specific Agile Framework is a Fine Balancing Act
Must adapt based on each organization’s unique culture and context.
Experts have to regularly remind both leaders and the Agile Team to remember that there is no one way to execute Agile practices in an organization.
Agile principles and practices are by their very nature to be adapted as needed.

Agile is an Umbrella Term for a Variety of Frameworks that Align with The Agile Manifesto
Every Agile team's goal is to deliver value-driven functionality with built-in quality and to do it quickly. This is where Fail Fast and Learn is priceless. Agile teams who wish to deliver both amazing product features that delight customers, as well as do it fast, must learn to quickly change course when it is realized that a product feature is heading down the wrong path.

The Agile Umbrella
The Agile Umbrella has some key characteristics:

Deliver Value: an absolutely key driver behind anything Agile is to deliver value.
Continual Improvement: Agile promotes incremental improvement to minimize resistance from all who are involved.
Flexibility: flexibility is one of the foundations of any Agile Framework.
Trust and Respect: Agile Frameworks promote trust and respect because such trust and respect motivate Agile teams.
Cultivate Mastery: this built-in structure for Agile team members to hone their skills further motivates the Agile team.

New Terms
Agile Umbrella: A term that refers to the various Agile Frameworks that follow the Agile Manifesto's values and principles

Scrum Framework
Scrum is by far the most common Agile Framework.

The features are delivered in iterations known as Sprints.
The Team conducts Daily Stand-Ups in which they provide updates to each other.
Retrospectives are conducted to identify opportunities for improvement at the end of each Sprint.
Specific roles, as well as certain Ceremonies are recommended in the Scrum Framework.
Scrum Pillars
Transparency - Transparency builds trust and openness both within the Agile Team, as well as with those stakeholders outside the Agile Team.
Inspection - Inspection involves the business users reviewing the Agile Team’s progress towards the defined goals.
Adaptation - Agile Teams adjust and adapt based on opportunities for improvement that are identified either by the Agile Team themselves or through feedback from others outside the team.
Scrum Pillars: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation
Scrum Pillars: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation

Scrum Values

5 Scrum Values
Focus - Everyone in the Team focuses on the work to be completed in order to deliver the Sprint goals.
Courage - Members of the Team need to have the courage to do what is right to ensure the Sprint goals are met.
Openness - The Team and its stakeholders agree to a culture of openness.
Commitment - Commitments build trust within the Agile Team members, as well as with the business users and leaders.
Respect - Respect is a key in Scrum for a high achieving Team.
Scrum Values:  Focus, Courage, Openness, Commitment and Respect

New Terms
Scrum Pillars: Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
Scrum Values: Focus, Courage, Openness, Commitment, Respect
Scrum: Scrum is one of the most popular Agile frameworks for developing complex products, with an emphasis on value delivery
Sprint: A Sprint in Scrum is a repeatable fixed time-box iteration during which a minimum shippable product is delivered

Project Vision, Daily Stand Up and Sprint Planning
Project Vision
Project Vision Ceremony is where the business leaders identify the business need the project’s product deliverable is intended to achieve.
Agenda- Discuss the project goals, identify sponsor, and outline project vision.
Occurs once per project; scheduled before the project launch.
Scrum recommends this ceremony to be time-boxed to 1 hour.
Outcome- Business leaders create a desired future state statement.
Daily Stand Up
The Daily Stand Up is used to synchronize activities and create a short term plan for the next 24 hours.
It is time-boxed to 15 minutes and is held every day, ideally at the same time daily.
Three questions are addressed by each Team member briefly.
First, what did I do since the last time we met?
Second, what do I plan to accomplish today?
Third, what impediments am I encountering?
This is a very valuable Ceremony in which all Team members get an opportunity to report issues they are facing; cultivates transparency across the product development journey.
Sprint Planning
The Team self-organizes and plans out the work to be performed in the Sprint.
The work is prioritized by the Product Owner.
Time-boxed to not more than eight hours for a one-month Sprint.
Agile Team works with the PO and Scrum Master to address the following three questions: First, what are we committing to deliver in the upcoming Sprint? Second, how will we complete the work required to achieve this commitment? Third, what are the respective estimates for each user story and associated tasks?
The Agile Team takes the prioritized backlog items and collaborates on how to carry out the work.
Sprint Review/Demo, Retrospective and Release Planning

Sprint Review/Demo, Retrospective and Release Planning
Sprint Review/Demo
Purpose is to generate feedback and nurture collaboration
The Team demonstrates the Sprint’s incremental work to the PO and other business representatives.
The Team and PO transparently discuss accomplishments, as well as opportunities for improvement.
The PO determines if the Sprint deliverables are acceptable based on the Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.
Occurs once at the end of each Sprint with a time-box of 4 hours for a one month Sprint.
Sprint Retrospective
The Team self-inspects its performance during the Sprint and identifies practical opportunities for improvement for subsequent Sprints.
Retrospectives are held after the Sprint Review; time-boxed to 3 hours for a one month Sprint.
The Team also discusses what went well, as well as what to continue to doing that is working very well for the Agile Team in terms of delivering value.
Release Planning
The Team develops a Release Plan that defines when a collection of functionality will be delivered to the customer base. *Agenda is to discuss critical dates and milestones, coordinate with dependent departments and systems.
Only occurs when there is a Release; time-boxed to 20 minutes.
Scrum Roles and Artifacts
Scrum Roles
Similar to other Agile Frameworks, there are 3 core roles in the Scrum Framework.

Product Owner, who is the voice of the customer.
Scrum Master, who is the key facilitator.
Agile Team, also known as the Scrum Team sometimes.

Scrum Artifacts
Product Increment clarifies what is being delivered in each increment at the end of each Sprint.
The Product Backlog is the prioritized list of work to be delivered by the Team.
The Sprint Backlog contains the prioritized items that the PO has designated for the Sprint.

Kanban Framework
Kanban has its origins in lean product development, an approach to product development inspired by of lean manufacturing principles and practices at Toyota.

Lean Principles
Lean product development focuses on 7 fundamental principles:

Eliminate Waste- Anything that does not add value to the customer.
Build in Quality- Lean focuses on good practices to ensure integrity and prevent defects.
Create Knowledge- Lean encourages both training and peer to peer knowledge transfer.
Defer Commitment- Lean recommends the Agile Team wait until the "last responsible moment" to make a decision, which allows for additional time to innovate.
Deliver Fast- Lean encourages the Agile Team to create and deliver the product incrementally.
Respect People- The Team must feel trusted and valuable to think and solve problems for themselves.
Optimize the Whole- Lean encourages decreasing barriers to increase efficiencies by decreasing the amount of hand-offs and reducing WIP.
Lean Principles set the foundation for Kanban.

Five Principles of Kanban
Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with 5 principles:

Visualize the Flow - The Team visualizes the workflow, which helps in organizing, tracking, and optimizing the work.

Limit Work in Progress- Limiting WIP helps to smooth the flow of work, reduce lead times, improve quality and delivery more frequently.

Manage Flow - By Monitoring and measuring the flow of work, issues are identified as soon as possible, which improves delivery predictability.

Make Policies Explicit - Establishing policies provides the Agile Team with explicit understanding of the processes for discussions around issues.

Improve Collaboratively - The Agile Team must own the team’s work related processes and work collaboratively to improve the processes being utilized.

Kanban Ceremonies
You will recall the 6 Scrum Ceremonies. In Kanban:

The Ceremonies are simplified.
There is no Sprint Planning Ceremony.
and there is no Sprint Retrospective.
Sprint Review/Demo is just called Review Demo.
So, the 4 Kanban ceremonies align with 4 of the Scrum ceremonies.

Kanban Ceremonies

Kanban Roles and Artifacts
Core Roles in Kanban
Product Owner -seen as the voice of the customer.
Facilitator - Team's Servant Leader.
Agile Team - These are the resources that collaborate and work on the product deliverables.
Kanban Artifacts
Kanban Board - A Kanban Board plays a valuable role since it articulates the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.
Cumulative Flow Diagram - A Cumulative Flow Diagram shows the total amount of WIP and how quickly projects are being completed.

Where Does Kanban Make Sense?
Since it focuses on the Agile Team’s workflow and throughput, Kanban is seen as a better Agile Framework option solution for projects where the work is likely to involve a large quantity of relatively small activities.
Kanban is also suitable for work that may arise on an ad-hoc basis.

Kanban Board: A visual representation of the Agile team's work at various stages with a separate column for each stage
Kanban: A lightweight Agile Framework that has its roots in Lean Principles
Lean Development: A process to eliminate Muda by leveraging innovative solutions to reduce cycle time and cost

XP Framework
Extreme Programming, also known as XP, is a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. XP has a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.

XP Values
There are 5 XP Core Values. They are

Simplicity - XP encourages reducing unnecessary complexity when building a solution to avoid waste.
Communication - All team members have transparency in being aware of what is expected of them in terms of deliverables, as well as being aware of what others in the team are contributing towards.
Feedback - Feedback in every iteration is taken seriously in XP. It provides an opportunity to demonstrate working results early and often.
Courage - Courage allows a team to bravely tell the truth about progress, estimates and any impediments to value delivery. It also gives the necessary fuel to adopt technical best practices.
Respect - Respect is key foundational element in XP for a high achieving Team.


XP Practices
The 5 XP core values discussed earlier set the tone for XP’s 13 core practices.

13 Core Practices
Whole Team - The Whole Team practice encourages the entire XP team to be collocated when practically possible. Collaboration tools can be leveraged to follow the Whole Team practice for Remote Teams.
Planning Games - XP encourages creative approaches to planning. The two formal planning ceremonies in XP are Release Planning and Iteration Planning.
Small Releases - Small and frequent Releases are encouraged in XP at both the iteration, as well as release level.
Customer Tests - In the Customer Tests practice, the PO works with the customer to describe one or more test criteria as part of defining the requested functionality.The team then ideally builds automated tests to confirm that the developed product’s acceptance criteria are met.
Collective Code Ownership - No single developer owns a piece of work. This strengthens the product with a broader knowledge of the code across the team.
Code Standards - Everyone in the team codes to a consistent standard in XP.
Sustainable Pace - A consistently high level of productivity can only be maintained at a sustainable pace.
Metaphor - It is important to adhere to a set of easy to remember standard naming conventions for items such as variable names, class names and methods to facilitate communication.
Continuous Integration - Software builds are regularly integrated by combining all the coding components together to verify that it compiles and works as a collective code base.
Test Driven Development - In TDD, the team writes the acceptance test before the actual coding is done.
Refactoring - The Team works to improve existing code to keep the design cleaner to maintain and develop new functionality on top of the existing code base.
Simple Design - The optimal design is the simplest one that works.
Pair Programming - XP advises team members to work on product deliverables in pairs; data shows that this produces higher quality code and costs less in the long run.
The XP Framework has a more stringent approach than many other Agile Frameworks. For example, Kanban is a lighter framework with room for flexibility.

XP Roles
The XP Framework has 4 core roles, 3 of which are quite analogous to the 3 core roles in most Agile Frameworks:

Customer- Somewhat like the PO; customer is the business representative.
Tester- Primarily responsible for quality assurance.
Coach- Acts as a mentor for team; also a Facilitator for the team.
Programmers- Developers who build the product.
.

XP Core Roles: Customer, Testers, Coach and Programmers

XP Ceremonies and Artifacts
All XP ceremonies align with the Scrum Framework ceremonies discussed earlier. The names are a little different for some of the ceremonies.

XP Ceremony Names
Iteration Planning
Iteration Review
Iteration Retrospective
Project Vision
Daily Stand Up
Release Planning
XP Artifacts
Since XP is a more thorough Agile Framework in terms of processes, all the artifacts covered in the Scrum Framework and Kanban Framework are included in XP.

XP (Extreme Programming): An Agile Framework with a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development
XP Practices: The core practices in XP, which are Whole Team, Planning Games, Small Releases, Customer Tests, Continuous Integration, Metaphor, Sustainable Pace, Code Standards, Collective Code Ownership, Test-Driven Development, Refactoring, Simple Design and Pair Programming

Challenges with XP
While many organizations get excited when they read that XP brings in rigor alongside the typical benefits of Agile, Agile teams often encounter challenges with XP:

XP is software centric - XP places emphasis on software development practices, unlike many other Agile Frameworks in which the emphasis is more on streamlining processes.
XP Coaches are Tough to Recruit - Recruiting experienced XP coaches is a challenge. XP coaches are expected to be familiar with software development, as well as have the right personality and temperament.
XP is Complex - XP is complex to implement and often feels anti-Agile to some organizations and their leaders. With 13 defined practices, XP has considerably more practices than many other Agile Frameworks.
Organizations who are thinking of XP need experienced XP Coaches, a willing and highly skilled team of programmers and leaders who have the resilience to guide the organization through the initial transformation.

Course Recap
Let’s do a quick course recap.

In the first lesson:

We first learned that Agile is a Mindset. It is essential to be agile and not just do the mechanics of what agile recommends.
We then went on to cover the Agile Manifesto. We talked about how the need for agile grew organically as a result of experts realizing that there was a gap in customer value delivery in many projects that followed the traditional waterfall or process centric structures. We discussed the importance of the 4 Paired Core Values and their associated 12 Guiding Principles.
The lesson also talked about the difference between Agile and Waterfall. The advantages and disadvantages of each were covered to ensure everyone appreciates that one size does not necessarily fit all projects.
We finished up by talking about some misconceptions of Agile. If you can avoid such misconceptions, you will become a valuable member of an agile organization.
In the next lesson;

We talked about the characteristics of high performing Agile Teams.
We then proceeded to talk about the size, structure and skills of a High Performing Team. We discussed how Agile frameworks recommend a team size of between 5-12 skilled resources that are self-organizing and cross-functional with T-shaped skills.
We looked at Agile governance and how, based on the Agile Manifesto’s guidelines, Agile recommends a lightweight and simple approach to governance. Where possible, decentralized decision making is encouraged.
We finished up by talking about some pitfalls in which High Performing Agile Teams disintegrate and how to avoid those situations.
This lesson emphasized how High Performing help uncover ways to mitigate the impact of threats, as well as profit from opportunities for the organization.
In the final lesson:

We talked about the value of Agile Frameworks. We discussed how an Agile Framework takes the abstract principles of the Agile Manifesto and gives it a practical shape.
We then looked at the important characteristics of the Scrum Framework, which is by far the most common Agile Framework in use across various industries globally.
We proceeded to examine the important characteristics of the Kanban Framework with its origins in lean product development. Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with considerable flexibility.
The final Agile Framework we looked at was XP, a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. We discussed XP’s stringent and strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.
We finished up by talking about some of the challenges of adopting the XP Framework.


## freelancing part

Prerequisites. Concepts that the course assumes that you know already
Course Overview. High level outline of what we will cover in each lesson of the course
Why is this course important? What would this course provide and why would you take this course
Stakeholders. Key stakeholders involved in a freelancing eco-system
Project Overview. Overview of the project that you would do at the end of the course


Prerequisites
This course is primarily for those who already:

Know the fundamentals of digital freelancing.
Have a marketable skill that can be used to get work from clients.
For example: Web development, digital marketing, etc.
Have a stable internet connection
Have proficiency in:
English language
Microsoft Office or Google Workspace
Recommendation: Have completed a Nanodegree through Udacity and have at least 2 projects completed.
In this course, instead of discussing 'what is freelancing', we'll discuss more about best practices, strategies to succeed, tips and tricks to get hired, effectively manage projects etc.

We'll cover 5 different lessons:

Lesson 1: Introduction to Managing Freelancing Projects This is the lesson we're in right now! Here we'll introduce the course, discuss prerequisites and also touch upon the final project.

Lesson 2: Create a process to source clients In this lesson, we'll discuss how and where to find clients to work with. We’ll go into detail of using a freelancing platform as well as discuss how to apply to work on clients’ projects.

Lesson 3: Negotiate a Project Scope and a Pricing Framework Here we'll talk about things that we discuss with the client before we formally start a project with them, like project scope, pricing framework, any non-disclosure or service agreements etc.

Lesson 4: Managing Projects In this lesson, we'll discuss the actual work that you do with the client - how to manage projects effectively as well as a discussion on project management tools.

Lesson 5: Completing Projects Finally, we'll discuss how to formally (and gracefully) close out a client's project and secure payment.

Here are some reasons why this course is of value to anyone starting their freelancing journey:

Start to Finish. Discusses all the stages of a freelancing project journey from sourcing clients to project completion

Bootstrap. Help bootstrap your freelancing career by breaking the deadlock of not being able to find clients due to lack of a comprehensive freelancing profile at the outset

Practical experience. The entire course is based on learnings from practical experiences and will discuss a variety of scenarios throughout the course which could be faced by you in your freelancing journey

Freelancer: This is you, who has a skill that can be used to work on client’s paid projects.

Client: Someone who is looking to get a specific task/project done through a freelancer and pay for it. A client could either be an individual or a company.

Intermediary: Helps clients and freelancers find each other, and in some cases, manage payments and disputes. Examples of intermediaries are freelancing platforms, job sites etc.

Project Preview
At the end of the course, you will work on a project where you will work on the following:

Work with a mock client to practice the initial communication stages.
Work through the project management process using a tool called Trello as well as setting up project milestones.
Prepare an invoice for a client.


The goals of the project are for you to be able to implement what you learned in this course to ultimately:

Find and apply for freelance jobs by creating a process to source clients.
Use best practices to negotiate a project scope and choose a pricing framework aligning with the client's needs.
Manage projects by maximizing value for the client.
Formally close out a project and secure payment.

Introduction
In this lesson, we'll start with the first phase of our freelancing journey: Sourcing Clients.

Sourcing Clients - first phase in the freelancing journey
At a very high level, we'll discuss two things in this lesson:

How and where to find clients for whom we can work
How to apply to work for clients using platforms to increase our chances of getting hired
Lesson Outline
We'll go through the following concepts in this lesson:

Setting the Mindset. We’ll start with setting a mindset to adopt when starting a freelancing career which would make it quite helpful to go through the rest of the lesson and the course.
Channels to Source Clients. Next, we will discuss the different channels available out there to find clients
Freelancing Platforms: Profile and Walkthrough. We’ll dive deeper into freelancing platforms which are a great way to find clients when you are starting a freelancing career. After a brief introduction, we’ll discuss profile creation and platform walkthrough.
Sending an EoI (Expression of Interest) to clients. Here we’ll discuss how to apply to work on client requests on freelancing platforms to increase our chances of getting the project or task
Lesson Review. Lastly, we'll summarise what we learnt
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Utilize freelancing platforms to find new clients.
Create a profile on a freelancing platform.
Send an initial expression of interest (EoI) to requests from clients by using strategies to increase your chances of getting hired.

Maximising Value for the Client: A Mindset
Whenever we are making choices in a project (for example tools to be used, strategies to follow, etc.), we should always wear the client’s hat to think about them and see how we can maximise value for the client.

It’s a great long-term strategy to evolve your freelancing career. As mentioned earlier, if I had to pick the most important idea in this entire course, it would be this idea.

This is a mindset that you will develop over time. As you go along, you’ll see examples, scenarios, strategies using this mindset, and this attitude of focusing on the value for the client, throughout this course. That will help you internalise this concept further.

Still thinking about it?
Still thinking about how maximizing value for the client works in real life? You may still have questions like the following:

Is that just a best practice in theory and doesn’t really go well in today’s times of fast-paced and cut-throat world?
Could this make the clients take us for granted?
If other freelancers are not focusing on maximizing value for the client and focusing on making the maximum revenue for themselves irrespective of the client’s needs, will I relatively lag behind?
Try it out and see how it works for you. You may realize that it not only pays you in the long term but could have a significant impact in the short term as well. For example:

Good reviews and more clients. If a client realizes that you made them save money by working smartly (like using the right tools, being efficient, etc.) they may leave you a good review which would be helpful to get hired for future jobs and get more clients.
More work from the same client. If a client finds out through another freelancer a more efficient way to do things, they may no longer be interested in you and may just go with the other freelancer. However, when they know that you are conscious about the efficiency of time and their money, you might be their first choice if/when they have more work in the future.
Satisfaction. Lastly (and most importantly), it will give you the satisfaction of a job well done.
Let's take one more pass to make this clearer by jumping into some personal examples from my own freelancing journey:

Personal Examples
Personal Example #1

Personal Example #1 Summary
Have tried to maximize value for the client in numerous ways while working with 90+ clients in the last 5 years.
One client was trying to build platform collecting government data using public APIs. Data wasn’t standardized.
Client wasn't technical, so did not know much about coding or APIs
I found a library on Github repo that would allow collecting data in the way we wanted to and would save a lot of heavy-lifting
Spent time using it instead of creating a customized solution that could cost the client much more $$
I could have just built it from scratch and charged for all the work but it did not seem to be the right thing to do and not efficient for the project
The client continued to give me work on other parts of the application which meant a lot for me back then when I had just started out.
Doing things most efficiently for a client will not just make you satisfied, it will earn your trust in the client ending up in great reviews and more work from the same client.


Personal Example #2

Personal Example #2 Summary
Working as a freelance consultant on a development project
Noticed that client is overpaying for Amazon cloud ($500/month) to host their application. Their needs didn't match their infrastructure, which was oversized.
Didn’t need to look into it (not much revenue for me), but felt it was in the interest of the client
It helped reduce their costs by 90% eventually! Deepened clients trust in me and resulted in more work

Channels to Source Clients
Broadly, the following are the different channels that you can tap to find new clients to work for:

Social Media
On Social Media, you could just post about your availability to work on projects in your area of expertise, and get noticed. Even clients use these platforms to advertise their requirements in order to find freelancers to work on their projects.

Freelancing Platforms
These platforms are marketplaces that are specifically designed for clients and freelancers to find each other. They not only help with discovery but also help with payments, any disputes, etc.

Because of their importance, you’ll see us diving deeper into freelancing platforms later in this lesson.

Networks
By networks, we mean your friends, family, ex-colleagues, etc. whom you already know. Networks could help you get valuable clients through referrals.

Pros and Cons of Each Channel

What is a Freelancing Platform?
A freelancing platform is a marketplace of clients and freelancers.

Each client on a freelancing platform has a task or project that they publish on the platform
Freelancers apply to work on these tasks
Clients hire a freelancer who is available and qualified to work on their task.
Diagram of necessary parts of a freelancing marketplace.
Elements of Freelancing Platforms
Key elements of a freelancing platform are:

List of job requests from clients. These are tasks or projects that the clients want to get done. Each job request has the following elements:
A title and description of the project. Gives a brief idea of what the project is about.
A proposed payment type. Whether fixed cost or hourly.
A proposed cost. The cost that the client is willing to pay. This will either be an hourly rate or an end-to-end fixed cost depending on the payment type. This proposed cost is usually negotiable.
Skills. Skills that the project requires. This could include names of programming languages, off-the-shelf tools, or high-level domains like web development, android app development, etc.
Filters. Allows filtering the list of job requests by skills, payment type/pricing structure, rate, cost, etc.
Automatic filtering. Some freelancing platforms use Artificial Intelligence to decide which jobs to show to which freelancer, depending on their frequency of use, reviews of work on specific skills, overall rate, etc. This enables different freelancers to see different jobs instead of everyone seeing the same list, hence increasing relevancy and reducing competition.

Profile
The first thing that you would do when you sign up on a freelancing platform is to create a profile.

A profile on a freelancing platform is information about you. It would contain fields like:

A short bio about yourself
Educational background
Areas of expertise
Past projects and relevant experience etc.
Note: Every freelancing platform will have its own set of fields in a profile, but the above fields are generally common across platforms.

Profile vs Resume
A profile may sound very similar to a resume but it is different from a resume in many aspects. Here are some of the differences:

Crisp and direct. A profile is much more brief and direct in its tone as compared to a resume.
Only relevant details. A profile would only contain details that would be relevant to a client's work. For example, co-curricular activities or volunteering experiences which are common in resumes, are less common in profiles on freelancing platforms.
Less formal. It's ok to say things like 'you will not charge if the client is not 100% satisfied', in your bio in the profile. It is ok for such profiles to be less formal than resumes.
All in all, the freelancing market is more direct and need-based. Clients are only interested in seeing what you can do for them for their project at hand.

Best Practices
Let's go over some best practices to write a good profile:

If it can be shortened, do it!
Call out your core expertise.
References to past work.

Summarizing the key fields in a profile:

Name
Short bio. A brief description of your skills and experience.
Remember to point out your core skills.
Also, specifically calling out what you have done for clients in the past using your core strength gives an additional metric to the client about what you can do for them. It also demonstrates your subject knowledge and the ability to measure success as compared to simply mentioning your skill.
Could also mention any perk that you provide to clients to stir up a conversation with them (like free 30 minutes call).
Skills. List down each skill you have with short descriptions.
It is good to call out significant aspects of your experience with these skills. As in the bio, quantifying your past success with a specific skill not only demonstrates to the client that you can actually work using that skill successfully but it also demonstrates your knowledge in the subject and ability to express the result quantifiably.
It's also a good idea to give links to past work or past employers with whom you worked (if it's not protected by a Non Disclosure Agreement) to bring credibility to your claim.
For some evaluation metrics of the work done, you need to educate the client by providing references to average etc., for them to be able to appreciate the metric.
Past experiences/relevant projects. List down past experiences and/or projects to demonstrate your work in the past.
Again, it is a good idea to provide any links to your projects (as long as they are not protected by an NDA). This will give the client direct access to your work and the output to your work. If you are early in your career and don’t have much work experience, link to a personal project could help in showing-off the kind of work that you can do for a client.



Exercise: Create a Profile!
In this exercise, you will create your own profile, like you would on any freelancing platform. The fields that need to be filled in for the profile are given below. As discussed in the lesson, while you are creating the profile, keep in mind what the client is looking for when they are browsing a profile.

Expression of Interest
An expression of interest is a short note that you send to a client on a freelancing platform to apply to work on their task.

It is a short message of about 2-4 lines to express your interest in working on the task. It may be sent over a chat or a message box that the freelancing platform enables to reach potential clients in response to the job requests.

Best Practices to Write an Expression of Interest
Let’s look at some of the best practices to write an EoI that could be helpful in winning a project from a client. A lot of these will come naturally to you when you wear the client’s hat and prioritize maximizing value for the client.

Re-iterate understanding of the problem statement. It is important to reiterate the understanding of the problem in your own words. This not only helps with getting on the same page with the client but builds trust in the client that you are making an attempt to get on the same page and fully grasp the problem at hand. For example:
“Looks like you need to scrape www.xyz.com and store that info in a CSV”
If you already have a quick tip to solve the problem, share it with the client!. In some cases, if you already have a quick tip for the client to get to the solution, share it with the client. This will assure the client of your understanding of the problem and ability to come with an efficient solution. This could also separate you from other freelancers who may not have a quick tip in their expression of interests or did not prioritize sharing it with the client at this point. For example:
“BTW, there is this X Python library that already does what you intend to do!”
Always start with the client’s problem statement instead of your skills/experience. Again, thinking from the client’s point of view, start with the problem statement of the client and not your own credentials. Like instead of saying that you have X years of experience with N clients, get straight into the problem statement and how it can be solved - then back up your claims by talking about your skills and experience. You will soon notice that more clients get back to you with this approach since they got someone who understands ‘their’ issue and is already thinking about how to solve it. Also, if they are lost in too many EoIs from too many freelancers, then one that starts with their problem statement re-iterated may catch their eye. For example:
“Looks like you need to…This can be done by….Happy to chat more. I have been working on multiple WordPress projects and..”


It is important to consider these as guidelines and not hard rules. The more clients and projects you work with, the more expressions of interest you write, better intuition you will develop to interact with potential clients.

Expression of Interest Examples:
Here are some examples to give you an idea of how expressions of interest may look like:

Example 1
Hi Peter - looks like you need to optimize the configuration of your Apache server so you can serve more requests at the same time. Did you already try the setting in httpd.conf? I have been playing with Apache Config quite often for multiple projects. Happy to chat.

Example 2
Hey Joe - happy to help with making your web app - looks like you need to get a CRUD application developed on Python with REST API. Django has a great library (called DRF) to do that. I am a web app developer with 6.5 years of experience with 60+ clients in the US and Europe. I have made Single Page Web sites as well as complex Web Applications on Django/Python and Java/Spring. Let me know if you’d like to chat.


Exercise: Draft Expressions of Interest (EoI)
Let's try to draft EoIs for the following job requests posted by clients on a freelancing platform. Keeping in mind the strategies discussed in the lesson. Try to come up with a short EoI of (a maximum of) 4-5 lines to express your interest in the request.



Job Request 1

Just launched the first version of our web site that provides teacher training to schools and colleges in 4 cities. However, our web site is not discoverable and no one is able to find it even when they enter the exact name of our organisation i.e ‘Education 4 All’. We need someone to help us with showing our web site in Google search results so we can get leads.



Job Request 2

We are developing a web application using Python and Bootstrap and are stuck with a few things:

We have a modal that pops up after the user logs in, but it doesn’t come in the centre of the screen. It is slightly off and just doesn’t align even when we have tried a lot to play with the CSS and the HTML.
The images are too big in the mobile version of the web application. We want the images to scale automatically based on the device.
We are doing a payment gateway integration using Python but want to apply a discount if the user asks for more than three products. We have no clue on how to implement the discount since the payment gateway API expects a fixed cost per unit.


EoI for Job Request 1
Write the expression of interest for Job Request 1 below:

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer
EoI for Job Request 2
Write the expression of interest for Job Request 2 below:

Solution: Draft Expressions of Interest
Take a look at the sample responses below and note the key aspects in each response. See how they match up with yours!



Expressions of Interest for Job 1
“Hi X, congrats on launching your web site for teacher training in 4 cities! Looks like you are looking for a digital marketing solution including SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

Rephrasing client's requirement in our own language - demonstrates understanding of the problem and technical expertise in solving it
From what I see, your web site shows a page load score of 55 on a desktop and 43 on a mobile which certainly has room for improvement. Google prioritises showing results that load faster.

If feasible, pointing out any quick issues observed - showing ability to analyse and helping build trust that we can solve the issue
I have worked on a similar project recently where we improved the google rank and click-through-rate by 35% in 1.5 weeks!

Showing past experience of working on something similar (with quantifiable outcome, if available)
The solution would be a mix of improving the social media presence, improving the format and structure of the website so it is more search-engine friendly as well as participating in popular forums in the teacher training domain"

Giving a high level overview of 'what's involved' - again demonstrating ability to think broadly to resolve the problem


Expressions of Interest for Job 2
“Hi Y, looks like you have multiple styles applied to the modal for alignment which may be conflicting.

Getting straight into the solution demonstrating know-how on the problem at hand
Happy to take a look at it. Images can be made responsive by using media queries or using a CSS framework. The Python API will need to be looked at in detail and could be limited to what the API allows - happy to take a look.

Giving a heads up that some issues may be inherent to the tool or API being used and there may be little room for customisation
I have been working on Python and CSS for X years now and have been debugging issues exactly like the above"

After briefly discussing the client's problem and a proposed solution strategy, backing up our claims by talking about our past relevant experience (instead of the other way around)


Getting a hang of it? Lets try to respond to a few more job requests that are less common than others

Job Request 1

I want to learn Java



Job Request 2

We need 1 e-com site with customer mechanism, cart and payment integration. We are not sure to rely on Wordpress,Magento but happy to consider tech stack. Please quote all amount to deliver full (and time taken).



Job Request 3

I am taking a CS 103 on Web Technologies and I am really confused with this assignment that is due the day after tomorrow. I need urgent help where someone can give me the solution code (with explanation on how they arrived at the solution so I can go through it after the submission and learn from it). Attached PDF has the three questions that I need to get done.

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer

Take a look at the sample responses below and note the key aspects in each response. See how they match up with yours!



Expression of Interest for Job 1
“Hi Z, happy to help you learn Java. I have been mentoring many developers in Java and have been working in Java for X years now. Do you already have experience in object oriented programming or will this be your first object oriented programming language? That will help us determine where to start from. Happy to chat”

Asking a question here not only shows the freelancer's experience in the area but also tests how serious the client is (given the short length of the job request). Wouldn't suggest writing a long note here until the client comes back with some information


Expression of Interest for Job 2
“Hi AB, looks like you are looking to get an e-commerce platform developed and are also looking for help on which tech stack to choose.

Acknowledging the client's ask and rephrasing it in your own words (demonstrating ability to digest the problem statement)
Happy to help you. I have developed two similar platforms hosted at www.xyz.com and www.abc.com and can help you choose an appropriate tech stack.

Demonstrating past experience with similar work
Happy to discuss the scope and effort estimate of the project. Would you like to get on a quick call later today evening (XST)?”

Proactively suggesting a call but not jumping the gun to give an exact time until the client responds


Expression of Interest for Job 3
Keeping academic integrity in mind, it is not advisable to send an EoI to this client and help in giving out the solution code (even if the client is willing to learn from it later) - they need to work on graded assignments themselves. This client should be reported to the platform.

Introduction
In this lesson, we will talk about what happens when a client has gotten interested in giving work to us and is trying to work on the finer details before starting work.

In our freelancing journey, this phase falls after we have worked to source a client but before we have formally started working with them. As you go through this lesson, you will learn how important this phase can be in a freelancing project. The more specific the details are, on scope and pricing framework, the smoother your project will be later.

Lesson outline including introduction, sourcing clients, negotiating scope and payments, manage the project, and formal completion.
Lesson Outline
Let’s take a look at what we’ll cover in this lesson.

Introduction to Project Scope and Pricing Framework. We’ll start by introducing the project scope and pricing frameworks.
Correlation between Project Scope and Pricing Framework. Next, we will discuss the correlation between the scope and pricing and how to figure out the best fit, keeping the client's priorities in mind.
How to set a Rate and Fixed Cost. How to set a rate and fixed cost when you are starting out your freelancing career.
NDAs and Service Agreements. Non-disclosure agreements and service agreements and how to avoid usual pitfalls before starting a project.
Edge Case. Lastly, we’ll discuss one edge case to talk about situations that are less common and best practices to deal with them.
Lesson Review. We'll close by summarizing what we went over in the lesson.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Work with the client to create a project scope by applying freelancing best practices
Determine a pricing framework by deciding between fixed cost or time and materials contract based on client needs.
Formalize the initiation of the project including NDAs and Service Agreements

Project Scope
The project scope is a document that lists the detailed requirements of a project including the project goal and the detailed features or workstreams required to be worked on, to achieve the project goal.

Once you agree to the work with the client, the first thing that you need to discuss (and preferably document) is what exactly you will be working on; this is the project scope.

Source of a Project Scope
Note that the project scope is a document that is given to a freelancer by the client to work on. You can of course help the client write a project scope but ideally, it’s the client that knows best what work needs to be done, and hence it is ideal for it to either come from them or written in active collaboration with them. That said, most non-technical clients may not have a project scope and may not even know what that is, in which case they may need your help to finalize a project scope (which you can of course bill them for).

In a later part of this lesson, we will also go walkthrough a sample project scope but let's build some more context around it in the next few sections.

Introduction to Pricing Frameworks


By pricing framework, we mean the structure within which you as a freelancer would get paid.

The two types of pricing frameworks that we'll cover are below:

Pricing Framework Diagram
Fixed Cost
As the name suggests, this means that the total cost of the project, end-to-end, is fixed at the start of the project. For example: You could say that you’d charge $100 to add a module to an existing website or you would charge $400 to build a static website or $3000 to build a web application.

A fixed-cost project is primarily work-based. You get paid for the work that you have done whose cost is pre-decided.
In a fixed-cost pricing framework, the cost is inclusive of any overheads. You would not bill them separately since the total cost of the project is already fixed and the client has already budgeted for it. Examples of overheads would be hardware or software licenses required to complete the client's project.
Time & Material
Time & Material (also called the 'Hourly' model) requires a fixed rate for the work that you do. This rate is usually set as an hourly rate. For example, you could set your rate to $25/hour which means you’ll get $25 for every hour that you spend working on the client’s task.

Time & Material pricing framework is time-based. You are paid based on the time you spend on the task. Keep in mind though, that some projects may put a cap on the maximum number of hours that you can spend here but what gets done in those hours cannot be fixed since this a time-based model, where you are paid for the time you spent.
You will bill any overheads on actuals to the client since it is not a fixed-cost project and you are billing for any time or material that you use for the project as you go along.


Spend some time to look at these two types of pricing structures in the above chart. You’ll see these coming in handy whenever you work with new clients. We'll come back to them later in the lesson.

At this point, when we know what is a project scope and what is a pricing framework, it is important to understand how the scope and the pricing framework of the project go hand-in-hand and are interdependent.

To explain the point, let's take the case of determining the fixed cost of a project:

Determining the Fixed Cost of a Project
To determine the fixed cost, i.e the overall end-to-end cost of the project that we want to charge the client, we want to figure out the following:

The end goal of the project. For example, building a web application, an android application, or a digital marketing solution to increase traffic on a website.
Different features or tasks involved in the project. For example:
an authentication module as a feature for the web application
a social media campaign as one of the tasks in a digital marketing solution.
Specification for each of the features. For example:
An authentication module may need a forgot-password feature in case the user forgets their password, a way to sign up new users, keep the user’s session active for a fixed time, etc.
A social media campaign may involve further details like which platforms will be running the campaign on, how many posts per day will we be posting (which define how much we need to do to prepare those posts), what kind of posts (image or text), how many contests, the duration of the campaign, etc.


Even if we have all the features but not the detailed specifications of each feature in a project, we won’t be able to estimate the fixed cost, because the devil is in the details and the effort required for each feature really depends on what goes in that feature. So we really need a detailed scope of the project.

And the detailed scope helps us determine the total effort that needs to be spent by us as a freelancer to work on the project. Once we have the total effort, we can then estimate how much we want to charge the client for that much work i.e total cost of the project.

Detailed scope, total effort, fixed cost
And that is why the pricing structure is dependent on the scope of the project. If the scope is not defined in detail, we may not be able to come up with a fixed cost for the project.

Let's close on this with a quick example:


Now if you remember our pricing framework slide where we introduced the two types of pricing frameworks, it would be worth adding yet another point, that the scope is well-defined in a Fixed Cost pricing structure whereas it may not be as well defined in a project with Time and Material pricing structure.



Project Scope - Walkthrough
Now we know what we mean by a detailed scope in a project scope document and the importance of it to decide a pricing structure before the project begins. With this knowledge, let us walk through a project scope document to see what it would look like:


Summary:
Project scopes vary significantly in their formats and depth.
A project scope may usually include the following elements:
End Goal. Defining the end goal of the project.
Delivery date. Deadline by when the client wants the project to be finished
Features (or work streams) required. List of features or work streams, required by the client, to achieve the end goal.
Features (or work streams) specification. Detailed specification of each feature or work stream.
The above are basic (and commonly used) elements in a project scope. Other elements may include (but not limited to) the following:
Cost & pricing structure
Cadence of status updates
Interim milestones
Names of team members
Dependencies (internal/external)
The main intent of the project scope is to define the following:
The end goal of the project
The building blocks that are required by the client to reach the goal.

Exercise: Scoping the Project
Message from the client:

"Thanks for expressing interest in the project and it'll be great if we could work together on this. I need to get a simple SPA web site with some static content that I have. I do want a chatbot to be integrated in the site that can talk to my visitors. For visitors who are logged in, full listing of all products would be available to be browsed. I am happy to offer $450 for this web site."



How would you plan to scope for this project? What will be your next steps after receiving the above message from the client?

Solution: Scoping the Project
The client mentioned a few features of the proposed web site, in her message, which need to be more explicit and broken down. Listing them down here:

The client mentioned "for visitors who are logged in" which means the web site needs an authentication module to be built in as well which would include login/logout/forgot password/sign up etc.
The above could involve requiring an e-mail module (for 'forgot password' for example) and needs to be scoped out with the client.
The client also mentioned about a chatbot which needs to be further broken down into the features needed etc.


Next step, would be to suggest the client to come up with a detailed requirements document for the project which could act as the single source of truth while the web site is being developed. The document can also be developed along with the freelancer (you) if the cost of it is included in the project. If the client is non-technical, most likely they would require developer's support to come up with detailed requirements. Here is a sample note that could be sent to the client, in response to her message:

"Great - happy to help you here. Looks like you need an authentication module (which would probably need an email module for confirmation emails, password requests, etc.) and a chatbot on the web site.

Re-iterating what the client needs, in your own words, and breaking it down will not only help the communication with the client but also help make it clear for the client herself
There are some good third party chatbots available that we could just integrate and save good amount of effort.

Another example of trying to maximize value for the client. The client will appreciate that you are not just interested in building everything from scratch (and hence increase monetary value for yourself) but proposing what is most cost-efficient for the client
I think it makes sense to come up with a detailed requirements spec for the website to be on the same page on each and every feature needed for the website to be built. I am happy to help you in coming up with this document if you think that'll help. That could be our single source of truth while we develop the website and could also be our reference doc that we keep updating in case the scope evolves.

Non-technical clients may not appreciate the importance of investing time into a requirements doc, so a little explanation is good before we get on a call with them about it
The effort estimate could then be done based on these requirements (though off the top of my head, based on the information so far, the cost estimate seems to fall in the range of $500-$700 approximately).

It is a good idea to give the client a high level range of the estimated cost at this point. This is to make sure that there are no surprises and either of you are not wasting time in case the client's budget is much lower.
Happy to chat sometime."

Avoiding suggesting a time at this point to avoid blocking your calendar until you know that client is really interested to move forward. Also, when we talk to the client, we can gauge how specific is their scope and can suggest an hourly rate instead if the scope is not specific. 
It is worth reiterating here that the above are guidelines and not hard rules. There are no hard rules. You might need to gauge each situation and see what makes the most sense in any particular situation. The more clients you work with, the better you will be in gauging a good response. Remember to have a mindset of how you can maximize the value for the client, and to appropriately demonstrate that mindset.

For a Time and Materials contract, you might see a large variation in the rates that freelancers charge. When we are starting out, it leaves us with the question of what should our rate be. Similar questions arise when trying to decide a fixed cost for a project, given a project scope.

Let's try to answer that by putting on the client's hat when they are trying to hire someone from a platform. From a client’s perspective, when they are deciding whether to hire a freelancer from a freelancing platform, they would primarily look at three things.

Profile. The profile of the freelancer on the platform (skills, relevant experience, etc.)
Reviews. Reviews that other clients have left about the work that they got done from the freelancer
Cost. the amount that it would cost the client to hire the freelancer
When we are starting on a platform, even though we can charge the same rate as other freelancers, a lack of reviews from other clients could reduce our chances of getting hired since the client could just go with a freelancer with the same rate and good reviews.

Deadlock - the chicken-and-egg problem
The issue discussed above is actually a chicken-and-egg problem.

Freelancers who have good reviews on the platform get hired
To get good reviews, we need to get hired.
This could be a pretty hard problem when we are just starting our freelancing careers. But to really break this deadlock it’ll be helpful to again go back to focus on quality work for the client.

To break this deadlock, if we go back to our discussion on maximizing value for the client, when we are starting off a freelancing career, if we really focus on doing quality work for clients than a justified pay for it, at the start, then we can build a good profile, get good reviews, build trust with existing clients. Sooner than later, we will realize that this balance (of work vs pay) gets better as our reviews and profile builds up and we can command the rate and the pay that we really deserve. Keep in mind that along with the reviews, you are also building up your profile as you go along by gaining more experience and projects to demonstrate your work to other clients.

Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
A Non-Disclosure Agreement is a legal document to ascertain that the freelancer does not transfer any information obtained from the client for the purpose of the project to any third party without purpose and authorisation.

This helps protect client's sensitive information like source code, passwords, business plans, secret sauce, etc. that the client needs to share with the freelancer for them to work on the project.

Service Agreement
A Service Agreement is a legal document that lists out the terms of engagement between the client and the freelancer. Examples of items that might be included here are:

Interim delivery schedule. For example frequency of code drops or weekly update schedule.
Working with similar companies. Whether the freelancer can work with companies that work in the same domain as the client.
Hiring employees that work for the client. Restrictions on freelancers hiring client's employees.
Terminating the contract prematurely. Conditions for terminating the contract before the formal end date.
General Recommendations
Following are general recommendations for a few specific types of clauses that may appear in NDAs or Service Agreements. Note that the following are general guidelines but to protect your interests, it is strongly recommended to take legal advice before you sign any contract or agreement with a client.

Unlimited Liability. If things go wrong and you are held wrongly liable, the contracts may allow unlimited liability which means you may need to pay an indefinite amount to cover the losses. A good idea is to limit your liability to a monetary amount of all the service fees that you received from the client.
Indemnification. Indemnification happens when you need to compensate the client for a breach of the contract. There is a rare chance that you get into a situation where the client wrongly puts charges on you and you need to indemnify. If it does happen, it could lead to significant monetary losses. To mitigate the risks, it is a good idea to limit the extent of indemnification to the sum of all the fees that the client paid you for the services you provided.
Validity. It’s important to make sure that contracts like Non-Disclosure Agreements do not have unlimited validity. A five-year period from the end of the contract is a good time frame to limit the validity, which means, you’ll be obligated to the agreement until 5 years after the contract has ended and not beyond.
Termination. It’s important to put in a premature-termination clause in case you don’t like the nature of work or the culture of the client and would like to quit before the project completes. Having a premature termination clause with enough notice period is good for a healthy exit from any client relationship. (Note that it is usually not a good idea to leave any client's relationship mid-way - this clause is only for extreme circumstances where you really have to take the step to quit midway, so you are covered in such a situation)

Exercise: Service Agreement Clauses
Here are a few clauses taken from a Service Agreement between a freelancer (called as Service Provider in the agreement) and a client (called as Company in the agreement). Read each clause carefully and see whether you as a freelancer would be OK with it. If you are not OK with any of the clauses, describe your reason and mention what change(s) would you suggest to the clause(s).

Note: An actual agreement's language is usually more legal-sounding and complex than below, but is simplified for the purpose of this exercise.

Should the Service Provider's performance of this Agreement be below the regular standards expected by the company at any point, the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Service Provider, with immediate effect.
The Service Provider will indemnify the Company and its employees in case of any breach of the Agreement by the Service Provider under this Agreement.
The Service Provider will not directly or indirectly, engage in any employment or paid engagement with a Competitor Business with services similar in nature, for the duration of the Agreement and a period of nine months from the termination of the Agreement
Clause 1
Mention if you are OK or not OK with the first clause. If you are not OK, describe your reason and mention what change(s) would you suggest to the clause

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer
Clause 2
Mention if you are OK or not OK with the second clause. If you are not OK, describe your reason and mention what change(s) would you suggest to the clause

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer
Clause 3
Mention if you are OK or not OK with the third clause. If you are not OK, describe your reason and mention what change(s) would you suggest to the clause

Exercise Solution: Service Agreement Clauses


See the points below about proposed changes to all the 3 clauses. Keep in mind that these are proposed changes and such adjustments to clauses may depend upon your relationship with the client, duration of the project etc. It is often helpful to be on the safe side even if the client is trustworthy. That said, none of this replaces the valuable advice and/or review of the agreement by a legal advisor.



"Below the regular standards expected by the company" is quite subjective and could be easily twisted against the freelancer at any point. A more specific clause like 'delay of more than 7 days in the deliverable' or 'more than 60% of the source code is poorly written and needs rewriting' is safer.
No upper cap on indemnification could be dangerous in case a misunderstanding ensues later. It is recommended to propose a cap of the total fee paid to the Service Provider in aggregate (or X times of it).
"Competitor Business" is subjective and could cause the freelancer to not be able to work with a large set of clients. It is good to either ask the client for a list of competitors that they do not want the freelancer to work for or reduce the time duration of this restriction.


When you are working on a freelancing platform with a client, sometimes the client may reach out to you to bypass the platform and just do direct payment from their bank account to yours. This is usually done to avoid the platform fee and just engage directly.

This might be very lucrative for you as a freelancer as well but is not a good idea in more ways than one:

Unethical and illegal. You accept the terms of the platform when you sign up which locks you into the platform for transactions with any clients that you find on the platform (unless the clients buy you out by giving a one-time fee which is usually quite high).
Lose Trust. You’ll see yourself losing the trust of the client by doing so. After all, if one can cheat the platform, they can cheat the client as well.
Dispute Management. It puts us in a very dangerous position since now the client can pay on his own terms in the absence of an intermediary to manage disputes.
Earn Respect. If you are ethical in your work and thinking, the client will respect that in the long term.
Satisfaction. Lastly, and importantly, you will achieve the satisfaction of doing the right thing.


Exercise: Discussing a Project Structure
Read the audio transcript of a conversation between a client and a freelancer below:

<<<<>>>>>>

Ron: Hi Naomi!

Naomi: Hey Ron

Ron: Thanks for your note and great to know that you'll be able to help me build this Android app that I have been trying to start for so long.

Naomi: Happy to be of assistance! Could you talk a little more about the requirements and the kind of functionality you need? I did read the high-level description in the job request and I agree with your decision to use React Native for it since it seems like there is a lot going on in the GUI.

Ron: Yes, exactly! I do have a detailed requirement doc that I wrote recently over the weekend. We might change some things here and there as we go along, but I think it gives a pretty good idea of what we want to build. I was also thinking of adding a custom scheduler and reminder system in there. Would be cool as more users sign up! I haven't added any dev-ops in there but we'll need some automation there as the data explodes.

Naomi: Awesome, I'll check it out.

Ron: Sure, I'll just share it with you, and would be good to know when we can get started. I am quite happy about this project since this has been on my radar for quite some time and I am doing side gigs to fund this project apart from my daily job. There's a lot to be done and I happy to have a long relationship working on this if things are going well.

<<<<>>>>>>

After reading the conversation, answer the following questions:

1) What pricing framework (fixed cost or time-and-materials) would you recommend in this case, and why?

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer
2) After listening to the conversation, list down any additional points that you would like to consider for the Service Agreement with the client.

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer

Exercise Solution: Discussing a Project Structure
Read the solution below and see how it matches up with yours:

I would suggest a time-and-materials pricing framework here since even though the client has a requirements document with the requirements listed down, he does not seem to be sure of numerous features in there and hinted a few times that the requirement may evolve.


The client in the conversation mentioned that he is funding this project out of pocket and using funds from side gigs that he works on. This suggests that the availability of funds for the project is regularly dependent on an external non-guaranteed source. To mitigate the risk of not getting paid due to lack of availability of funds, it will be helpful to keep the payment timelines very short (for example: within 2 days of delivery of work). Also, freelancing platforms allow clients to put payments in escrow and the platform itself releases the payment to the freelancer once the work is done and agreed upon by the client. That model would work well here since that will obtain the funds from the client in advance and would not be affected by any change in the financial condition of the client at a later point.
For the second one above, it is OK if you did not have the same consideration for the agreement but it is good to be watchful and mitigate any risks of scope creep or payment defaults via the agreement (if there's one in place). This aspect will of course come naturally as you work with more and more clients!


Lesson Outline
Let’s take a look at what we’ll cover in this lesson.

Best practices to manage projects effectively. We’ll start with best practices to manage projects effectively where we’ll talk about aligning priorities with the clients, effective communication, bringing in efficiency as well as a discussion on professionalism.
Project management tools. We’ll then talk a bit more detail about the project management tools available out there, and the pros and cons of using such tools
Trello Demo. We will specifically go through a tool called Trello which you can use to manage projects or even small tasks.
Edge Case: Scope Creep. Finally, we’ll talk about an edge case of what to do when a scope creep happens in a project.
Lesson Review. Lastly, we’ll do a quick review of what we learnt in the lesson
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Use best practices and strategies to manage client projects effectively.
Adopt effective communication strategies and tools to keep the client on the same page while you work on their project
Let's get going...
As we discussed earlier, this is the time for us to shine. All our hard work so far has been for this moment when we can actually show our skills and do something meaningful for the client as well as gain revenue out of it.

These best practices that we are going to discuss now, could help us lead to a successful project as well as happy clients. I have personally validated these practices by working with numerous clients from all over the world. I would say, as you go through these, take them slowly, try to internalize each of these before you put them into practice.

Best Practices: Aligning with Client's Priorities
When starting with best practices for managing projects effectively, first and foremost is aligning with the priorities of the client. Many projects really fail because they fail to align the project work with the client’s priorities and continue to do so even after they get signals of misalignment during the project.

Different clients may have different priorities, such as:

Time efficiency
Quality work
Cost efficiency
You as a freelancer would need to figure out what is the client’s priority. And I would say, this is more of an art than a skill. One needs to hear the client and sense their priorities. You could perhaps ask them a few questions to get a feel about what is important to them. The sooner you learn this art of gauging a client’s priorities, the better you’ll see yourself being on the same page with the client and lead to a project with a happy client.


Best Practices: Communication
Doing good work is important but not enough, keeping the client in the loop of that good work is critical.

Most of the digital freelancing that you do, would be done remotely. You may never end up meeting the client in person. This does leave room for misunderstandings and hence the need to think about a communication strategy at the outset.

Types of Communication
Communication in a project could be of different types and at different levels. Let's take a look at the different types:

Project Status. This is the most indispensable and common kind of communication in any project. It informs the client what was done since the last update. It’s also a good idea to maintain a schedule for status updates. This communication could be done through various means depending on the size of the project and the client's preference:
Project Management Tools (Trello, Wrike, etc.)
Emails
Calls
Slack, Whatsapp groups
Design Decisions. Conveying the decisions about the design of the solution, that you make while you are working on the project, to the client. This kind of communication may or may not be asked for, by the client, depending on the client’s technical expertise but it’s important for you as a freelancer to convey these decisions. This would help with the following:
Demonstrate to the client, your ability to think about the problem holistically
Demonstrate to the client, your expertise and knowledge in the domain
Educates the client about possible ways to work on the solution
Makes the client gain confidence that they are investing a well-thought-out solution
Communicates to the client about the efficient means that you are adopting to work on the solution
Some examples of design-decision communication are as follows:

Integrating an existing Python library. "To make the numbers human-readable, I’ll be using the Python humanize library. That’ll save us from writing a lot of code manually to make the numbers readable."
Using an off-the-shelf tool. "Instead of looking at the server logs to find out the referral URLs for websites linking to us, we could use this cool tool that does that for us automatically. It is free to be used for commercial web apps."
Process design. "Given the complexity of this module, it’s important to write the requirement spec in finer detail before we start implementing it. It will help us concretize our thinking, get us on the same page, as well as be a single source of truth to refer back to."

Heads up. This kind of communication informs the client of an issue that you foresee but the client may not be expecting. For example: delay in deliverables, external dependency not being met on time, change in your personal situation which may affect the project, etc. This is a very important kind of communication that many times freelancers (or even full-time employees) fail to do, leading to bigger problems later. Two important points to note:
Delays within reason are common but it is important to keep the client in the loop
Trying hard to meet the deadline despite a foreseeable delay is good and optimistic. Still, it is recommended to keep the client in the know so they can be prepared in case you don't meet the deadline.
Big Picture. Both you, the freelancer, and the client may get bogged with the details in the project. If you, as the freelancer, keep pointing back to the big picture and how our small steps are leading towards it, it would be valuable for the client to put things in perspective as well as inform them of:
why are we working on the current problem
how it fits into the big picture.
Some examples of big-picture communication are as follows:

Linking applicability of a feature with the user's context. "Ultimately, users of our mobile app would be those who commute quite often. So this GPS location detector that we have in production now would be quite useful in giving them the ‘local context’ wherever they are."
Linking the GUI built with the user's device usage. "Since many users may not care to download and install the mobile app and may just go to the website on their phones, this front-end framework that we have implemented will take care of the mobile responsiveness of the website so it looks good on the mobile as well."


est Practices: Efficiency
The client is running the project to get some value out of it. They usually want to balance the value with the required amount of time and money. Hence, it becomes important for you, the freelancer, to actively lookout for ways to work efficiently.

Clients may themselves not be conscious of what to prioritize and how to bring that intricate balance in order for the overall project to be efficient. They may assume that you would guide them wherever you see areas of how to be most efficient so they can achieve an optimal output with an optimal amount of time and money.

Potential areas to bring efficiency
Here are some potential areas to bring efficiency in a project:

Tools (off-the-shelf, paid/free). Picking the right tools would help:
avoid reinventing the wheel
get work done faster
Optimize sequence of work. Based on your judgment, you could optimize the sequence of work done. For example:
prioritize reusable modules
prioritize dependencies
This list of areas to bring efficiency is not exhaustive. It is important to be on the lookout for how you can bring in efficiency for the client’s project depending on the project’s context to result in optimal value for the client’s investment in it.

While you do that, it’s important to communicate that to the client (remember our communication discussion?) so they understand what value the optimization brings and can appreciate your contribution in bringing in that optimization.

Best Practices: Professionalism
The last topic in our series of best practices to manage a client's project is Professionalism.

Professionalism is more of an attitude, something that is displayed by the way you work with clients, the way you make decisions, the way you deal with unexpected situations. In this part of the lesson, we’ll talk about some areas of work in your freelancing journey that could portray professionalism. But you’ll realize that professionalism is something that is naturally developed as one works with clients over time.

Best Practices: Professionalism Examples

Attention to Detail
The client would love if your work is detailed enough and this could go a long way in your freelancing career. Example: your communication is detailed and specific, your software code is clear with comments, etc.

Do less but do it well. If there is less time, do less if you have to, but do it well (instead of doing a bunch of things not fully developed).
Balance with pragmatism. If the client is in a hurry they may not want you to spend time on the details, in which case, the scope of work is limited and we could do a precise job within that scope.
Precisely logging time. In time and material projects, where you need to log time, precisely logging time will not only give you satisfaction but the client will appreciate your integrity. You don’t want to hurt your reputation for a few hours in the time log. If you find yourself jacking up a few hours to gain some money, believe me, you are not the first one to try that but that’ll not only leave you dissatisfied, there will always be insecurity about the client questioning the time log leading to lack of confidence in your work
Written and verbal communication. Attention to detail in written and verbal communication not only portrays your professionalism but also gives an impression to the client that you are serious about what you do. Minor things like good grammar in an email, using correct cases in words, naming convention of files, or perhaps variables in a code do matter and demonstrate your alertness and seriousness towards the work
Consistency
Being professional is good, but always being professional is better. Some of the areas which may warrant consistency are:

Quality of work
Timelines
Communication
Consistency builds the trust of the client in you and this solid relationship could lead to a longer engagement or more projects.

Legal
Next, as touched upon briefly in the previous lesson, it will demonstrate your professionalism if you stay within the legal limits of any work that you do. For example:

Staying within the legal framework of freelancing platforms
Checking licenses and copyrights of third party libraries
Lastly, doing things right gives some kind of authority that can only be understood with your own practical experience.

Ethical Communication
Sometimes things may not go in your favor even when you are trying to maximize value for the client and being professional. It is quite important to maintain ethical communication in these times which could really go a long way. Instead of reacting to the situation which could lead to a long-term loss, responding may work much better. Try it.

A client wants to get an e-commerce website built but has no idea where to start from. The client does not know about off-the-shelf tools available and is looking for guidance on how to build it from scratch. The client knows what features they want in the e-commerce site but does not know how to build them, what technology to use and how to get started. As a freelance software developer, what are the first few steps that you will suggest to the client to start working on the project?

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer


First, I’ll suggest that the client documents the functional requirements of the e-commerce web site if not already done so, so they can list all the features they need on the site.

This will give an opportunity to the client to think clearly about the requirements and also to be on the same page with the developer. This will also help in the second point where these requirements are then used to see what is already built and available to use (to avoid re-inventing the wheel)
Second, and most important, is to do a prior art search on what existing tools and frameworks already achieve part of the functionality in the requirements so they can be considered to be used and/or customised (It is important to explain to the client why it is important to invest in it and how it could save them a lot of time, effort (and money) later). Thirdly, it is important to discuss with the client, the difference between an off-the-shelf solution and a custom solution with pros and cons of each.

Helping the client make informed decisions (hence, trying to maximise value for the client)

Project Management Tools
Earlier in this lesson, we talked about project management tools to be a key element used to communicate the project status to the client. They also help in planning project timelines and assigning tasks to different users.

There are many tools like Trello, Basecamp, Wrike, etc. that offer a variety of features for a variety of projects. The advantage of most of these tools is that they are completely on the web which brings the following advantages:

No not need to install anything
Can access it from any computer
Any new features are automatically installed and available
Can share work and projects with any user just by entering their email.
Pros and Cons of Using Project Management Tools
Here's a quick look at the pros and cons of using project management tools:

Pros and cons of using project management tools
Introduction to Trello
Now let's take a look at a specific tool called Trello that can be used to effectively track tasks in a project.


Trello is a project management or task tracking tool that can be used for a variety of purposes. At the core, it shows tasks for each project in an intuitive way arranged like post-it notes that can be moved around.

Summarizing below the key elements of Trello:

Boards. workspaces to keep track of projects. You'd ideally have one board for each project.
Lists. collection of tasks for each phase of a project. You'd ideally have one list for each phase of the project. For example: Requirements gathering, Implementation, Testing, etc.
Cards. Represent tasks or activities. You'd ideally have one card per task or activity. These cards are just like post-it notes that you could move across lists as the task moves across phases.
You could have as many boards, lists, or cards as you want in a project. You can also pull up the menu on the right and see all the recent activity or search for specific cards.

Trello is quick to learn and could be used for simple as well as complex projects.

Exercise: Communication Strategies and Tools
Picture this:

You have just got a new client to work on an application development project for the next 2 months. The client is totally non-technical and has never got an application built before. They have no experience with project management tools and only have limited knowledge of Excel sheets. The client's requirements are quite fluid and hence they have agreed to work on an hourly pay model where the pay for the time that freelancer has put in.


Solution: Communication Strategies and Tools
Since the client is completely non-technical, it makes much more sense to have a solid communication plan in place since there are bound to be misunderstandings later owing to a lack of technical understanding of the client. For example, clients may make strong assumptions about the sophistication of the features or the time it takes to build them. Also, the client may not understand the importance of investing time into app design, testing, etc.



Use simple project management tools

Since the client does not have experience with project management tools and only has a limited understanding of Excel, it makes sense not to overwhelm the client with a sophisticated project management tool and avoid the overhead of learning it. In this scenario, it makes sense to start simple by using Google Docs, Google Sheets, or Microsoft Excel to describe and discuss the project scope and timelines.



High-level requirements document

Even when the client has agreed to work on an hourly model, to avoid any surprises later, it is good to come up with a high-level requirements document involving not only the application requirements but any soft requirements like access to servers, deployment to the cloud, any license requirements, etc. Since the client is non-technical, they make the mistake of assuming the development cost to be all-inclusive and not realize other costs involved in hosting an application.



Communication frequency

For this scenario, it is important for the client to be on the same page as much as possible. This would require frequent updates to the client (more frequent than normal) on the progress made and its place in the big picture. This will mitigate the risk of gaps in understanding later when a larger chunk of work is already done.



Iterative development

Following an iterative development model, so the client is periodically able to (visually) see part of the actual application will be quite beneficial here. This will help keep things real and demystify any assumptions sooner than later. Also, this will keep the client questioning and pondering upon their own thinking of the end-product and make any adjustments as needed, early on.

[Question prompt here.]

This is an open-ended question, so your answer will be different from ours—but after you submit your response, we'll show you how we thought about the problem and point out some key things to consider.

Scope Creep
Scope creep in a project happens when a new requirement, which was not decided earlier, is added in the middle of the project.

Scope creeps could create misunderstandings and frustrations amongst both the client and the freelancer and sometimes may even become the cause of the client and the freelancer parting ways.

Let's take a look at ways to deal with scope creep:

Detailed requirement spec. The best strategy to deal with scope creep is to avoid it. You can avoid it by having a detailed enough requirement specification at the start of the project. This will help significantly reduce the chances of scope creep and will also help the client think clearly about their project.
Educate and negotiate with the client. Things do change in the course of the project and scope creeps are common. It is important to educate the client why you as the freelancer think that a requirement is out of scope. If the client agrees, they may be willing to pay for the extra effort.
The benefit of the doubt. Sometimes the client may be right in claiming the requirement to be part of the original scope or the delta effort may not be so much as to put the whole contract in jeopardy. If that is the case, it is in your interest to give the benefit of the doubt to the client and work on the requirement as part of the original estimate.

Exercise: Scenarios
The best way to assimilate and apply the concepts learnt in the lesson is to apply them in real-life scenarios!

Following scenarios cover less common situations but are good for thinking through our options and an ideal approach in such situations. Read each scenario below and try to answer the questions asked in the scenarios.

Scenario 1

In a call, the client describes to a freelancer that she is looking to build an automated script to fill an online form to buy a product at 00:00 hours from an online store. This has to be done as quickly as possible since there are other people who would be filling the form (when the product becomes available at 00:00 hours) and the product will only be given to first 5 customers who fill the form. The client wants to get a really fast script built that will fill the form automatically as well as fill it faster than others. The product web site is OK for customers to adopt any kind of automated script or alternate ways to fill the form.

The client says at the end - “In all fairness, since I am trying to win this form-filling effort to get the product, I can only pay you if I win it (i.e I am among the first 5) - I hope that is fair since that is anyway the goal of this task”

Write down what your response would be, to the last comment from the client:

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer
Scenario 2

Read the transcript of what the client said in a video call to a freelancer:

Client: “We have been working together for a year now and have established good trust in the relationship. I really value your contributions - thanks for all your hard work. If you’d like, I am happy to start paying you outside of the platform by a bank transfer so you are not charged an unnecessary fee. I really respect these platforms that help us meet so I am not suggesting anything unethical. Given our situation, you have already paid the platform fee for a year so they have made the money for making us meet. Also, I don’t want you to not get the true worth of your hard work. If you’d like to do this completely legally, you could invoice via the company that you run, since you have a contract with the platform but not your company”

These are suggested solutions to the scenarios. Your solutions may obviously be different but check if the key aspects discussed below are covered in your solutions.

(The more scenarios we cover like these, the more will our understanding deepen - hence, our continued focus on these scenarios in each lesson!)

Scenario 1 solution:

“I hear you and would have agreed to that if this was a regular project with a guaranteed outcome

acknowledge the concern showing you understand where the client is coming from
but since this is an exploratory project with also a competitive element in it,

clearly forming a base for why your proposed approach is fair
I would suggest I get compensated for the time I spend irrespective of the outcome. I will try hard to make a really fast script and will share my strategy beforehand.

Alternatively, we could share the risk by keeping a 30% markup/markdown depending on the outcome of the task. For example, if the effort estimate for the task is $150, then if it is successful, we mark it up by 30% i.e $195, else we mark it down by 30% i.e $105.”

suggesting an alternative, trying to reach a mid-way point while keeping the risk low. Also demonstrates innovation in coming up with a win-win solution.


Scenario 2 solution:

Response to the client: “I do understand your point but I’ll request to stay with the platform. It’s a great platform and I have a legal contract with them that may not allow me to bypass it even after a year. About invoicing via the company, I agree that would be within the legal framework but it may not be fully ethical on my part to bypass it that way. I am glad that the platform gave me a client like you who has given such a nice business - so I’ll like to continue to go via the platform. Happy to discuss if you have any other concern though”

In the long term, the client will respect you for being honest and ethical. After all, if one is being honest with the platform, they'll also be honest with the client.

Also, the platform will continue to protect you from any payment disputes in the future (an year with a client may not guarantee insulation against future disputes - in fact, many disputes do happen with long-time clients since the quantum of work and fee involved goes up over time and hence, the stakes are high)

Best practices to manage projects effectively. We started off by discussing strategies to effectively manage projects where we talked about aligning with client’s priorities, the importance of effective communication, working efficiently, and professionalism.
Project management tools. Then we talked about project management tools, their pros and cons, and when to use them.
Trello demo. We introduced Trello as a tool to manage client's projects
Edge case: Scope creep. Lastly, we touched upon an edge case of scope creep and potential ways to take care of it.
In the next lesson, we’ll talk about formally closing out a project and securing payment

Introduction to Completing Projects
In this final lesson, we will talk about what needs to be done when you’ve reached the end of the project. The phase is important to smoothly close out the project and also secure final payment from the client.

Final stage of the freelancing journey - Formal Completion
Lesson Outline
Let’s take a look at what we’ll cover in this lesson.

Marking the deliverables complete. We’ll start with marking the deliverables complete so both the client and the developer are on the same page that the required job is done.
Securing payments. Once the deliverable is marked complete, we’ll talk about securing payment
Invoicing. We will discuss sending invoices wherever required
Edge Case: Bad Review. We’ll talk about what to do in case we do get a bad review on a freelancing platform
Lesson Recap. We’ll do a quick recap of what we learnt in the lesson
Course Overview. Since this is the last lesson, we'll also do a high-level review of what we went through in this course!
Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

Assess with the client that all client's deliverables are met
Secure payments after the deliverables are complete
Send invoices to clients with all necessary information
Manage exceptions like a bad review from a client


Why is marking the deliverables complete, important?
When we are done with a project, it is important for both parties to agree that the requirements have been met. This becomes important for two reasons:

Clearing the final payment. Especially in fixed-cost projects, your final payment from the client could be blocked until the client confirms that all the requirements in the project scope have been met.
Formally end the project. It marks an end to the time that you need to spend on the project so you can allocate your time to other projects.


How can we mark the deliverables as complete?
To mark the deliverable complete and not keep the project lingering, there are two things that we can do:

Communicate in writing of completion (from your own email account)
Creates a record of you informing the client that the work is done
Puts a timestamp of completion
Set a timeline for the client to come back
Example: the client can report any issues with the deliverable within 48 hours of the delivery
Good to put this timeline in the contract/service agreement
This would set a deadline for your availability for the project (in case the project is not continuing)


Securing Payments
Once the client’s work is done and deliverables are marked complete, it is time to get paid for it. Let's see how it's done on a freelancing platform.

Freelancing Platforms with 'Escrow'
If you are going through a freelancing platform, it usually has an escrow feature that works as follows:

The client deposits the payment for the project before the project starts
When both parties agree that the work has been completed, the platform releases the payment to the freelancer
The advantage of this arrangement is:

The money lies with an intermediary now and could be helpful in dispute management if/when a third party needs to be involved.
This also helps in timely payments since the freelancer is no longer dependent on the client to make the payment in a timely fashion.
Other cases
If you are not working through a freelancing platform or the freelancing platform does not have an escrow feature, you can send a note to the client to get paid.

In some cases, you may need to provide an invoice to the client. In the next section, we’ll cover what goes in, in an invoice for the client.

Exercise: Securing Payments
Image of a conversation between two individuals
Read the following conversation between the freelancer and a client on a freelancing platform:
Freelancer: James

Client: Mark

The Conversation
James: Hey Mark - hope you are well! I have now completed the final line item in our requirements doc and pushed everything to the git repository. Hope it looks good. Please let me know!

Mark: Thanks for all the work, James. I do appreciate your services. Yes, I did check the repository and tested the code. It all looks great!

James: Awesome! I have just marked the job as done on the freelancing platform. Can you mark it as done as well on your end? That will help release the payment from the platform to me.

Mark: Sure - I will be happy to. I also wanted to ask you if you know how to add X library to the application?

James: Oh yes! That can be added by importing the library and making some configurations for the integration. It's doable on our app.

Mark: Cool - do you mind quickly making that integration as well? I'll mark the project as done as soon as you are done and will also leave a good review for all the good work.



Securing Payments
Would you as a freelancer go ahead and make the integration that Mark asked for? Also, what factors will determine your decision? Please mention a rationale for your decision(s).



exercise Solution: Securing Payments
There is no right or wrong answer to this question. Let's look at three of our options below.

Option A.
Insist that the integration does not fall into the originally decided scope and should be billed for separately after the current project is marked as done.

Option B.
Do the integration as requested by Mark so he can mark the project as done.

Option C.
Do the integration as requested by Mark and let him know but request him to consider paying separately for it since it was not in the original scope (leaving the decision to him).

The option we go with really depends on multiple factors like:

Estimated time/effort to do the integration
Quality of relationship with the client
Potential long-term relationship with the client
If the integration does not take too long (for example 15 minutes), I wouldn't insist too much on the scope and just do it for Mark and let him know (i.e. Option B).

If the integration takes a significant amount of time, then Option A would make sense.

Option C is handier if you do not want to risk breaking a good relationship with Mark, especially if there's more business expected from Mark, and yet you do want to be explicit about the agreed terms.



It is totally OK to make incorrect decisions early in your freelancing career. All of us do. As you work with more and more clients, you will be more confident in making decisions in unexpected situations. Again, there is no fixed formulae in these situations and it primarily depends on your relationship with the client and how high the stakes are in terms of relationship and effort/money involved.

An invoice is sent to the client to request payment for the services rendered.

Here are the key elements in an invoice:

Date. This timestamps when the request was made to the client to make the payment
Invoice ID. This is your own invoice ID that you maintain internally across all clients. You could choose a format that you prefer but this ID needs to be unique across all invoices and all clients.
Freelancer's name and address. For legal identification purposes, you need to put your name and exact office or home address in the invoice.
Tax IDs. Depending on your local tax law you may need to include your Income Tax ID and/or Service tax ID. These IDs are termed differently in different countries. For example, if you are in the US, service tax may be termed as sales tax. If you are in India or Canada, Service Tax may be termed as GST or Goods and Services Tax. In some countries, there is no service tax for international services. You could simply check your local tax law online to figure it out. Alternatively, you could just look up a sample invoice online that was generated for your country of residence to get an idea of the Tax IDs you need in an invoice.
Client's name and address. Client’s name and address for whom this invoice is for. If you are invoicing a company instead of an individual you’ll put the company’s name and address here. Services provided. Lists down the services that you provided to the client with the total cost. If you have agreed to provide a breakup, you can put individual costs as well. If it's a time and material contract, you can put in the rate and hours that lead up to the cost.
Mode of Payment. Lists how the client can pay you i.e the modes of payment that you are willing to accept. This could include your bank account information or e-wallet ID etc.
Due Date. A due date is not mandatory but it is a good idea to put it to mark a deadline when the payment is due. You could choose to put it depending on your understanding with the client.
Signatures. Signatures are not mandatory in electronic invoices. You, sending the invoice from your email address is enough proof that it originated from you. For digital invoices without signatures, you could put a line at the bottom that says “This invoice is digitally generated and does not require a signature”. Alternatively, you could use a digital signature or if the client insists, you could put a real signature using signature tools available in PDF viewers.


Apart from the key elements in an invoice, please note the following:

Format is not fixed. The format of the invoices is not fixed and you are free to choose a format that works for you. For example: you could place your address at the bottom of the invoice instead of at the top. Or you could put the due date at the bottom.
Send it from your own email account. It is ideal to send this invoice as an email to the client from your own email account, not from a client-owned email account that you got temporarily or via the client’s chat applications. This will create a permanent record of it to refer back to later.
Send it as a PDF, preferably. Instead of sending the invoice to the client as an editable document, it’s a good idea to export it in PDF format and then send it out since PDF formats are widely accepted on different operating systems and the client would not need a licensed software to open it.




Exercise: Periodic Payment
Picture this:

Client ABC has been working with a freelancer for 6 weeks now. They make the payment every 2 weeks, so they have paid for the first 4 weeks. At the end of the 6th week, when the freelancer raised an invoice, the client sent the following message:

Client ABC: "We will only pay half the amount for Module 3 since the deliverable has bugs in it. We have not been able to send you the list of bugs since we got you started on another module (Module 4) yesterday which is the priority at the moment. Let's finish Module 4 first and then we can get back on the bugs list for Module 3. Once you fix them, we'll be happy to pay you in full for Module 3"

How will you respond to this message? Frame a response that you would send to the client and then compare it with the one mentioned in the solution.

Exercise Solution: Periodic Payment
First, let's list down some key aspects from the client's message:

The client is not willing to pay in full for Module 3 since it has bugs in it but is willing to pay half now and half later (once the bugs are resolved).
The client has not shared the bugs list for Module 3 as yet with the freelancer.
The client asked the developer to start work on Module 4 because that's a priority at the moment.
The client wants to finish Module 4 before getting back to fixing bugs for Module 3 and then pay for it.


Now let's evaluate these aspects:

In order for the client to withhold any payment, there needs to be a reason given to the freelancer. Here the reason is not considered to be fully given since the bugs list is not provided.
If the bugs are significant enough for the payment to be held off, it is not ideal for the client to start on another module without getting the bugs fixed and clearing the payment of a previous module (what if the client needs to get a Module 5 built urgently (after Module 4) and delays the fixing of bugs for Module 3 even further?)


Considering the above, here's a proposed response to the client's message:



Freelancer: "I understand that our priority has changed and we need to work on Module 4 immediately but I would expect to get a list of bugs for Module 3 now since the payment is being held off because of it. Also, if we do want to only focus on Module 4 for now, I'll suggest that we make the payment for Module 3 in full so my regular cash flow doesn't get hurt. I'll be happy to come back and fix the bugs in Module 3 when you are able to send me the bugs list and when Module 4 is done. Alternatively, I am happy to spend a day now to fix bugs for Module 3, depending on the complexity of the bugs, so it can be marked as complete and we can clear the payment. Happy to get on a call to talk about this".



Also, to avoid such situations with clients, it is recommended to set a time range, in the service agreement, within which the client needs to get back to the freelancer in case of any bugs (for example 2 working days from delivery). For any bugs discovered later, the freelancer can fix them in the following pay cycles. This will avoid a situation where payment is delayed indefinitely because of a lack of discipline in managing the module development on the client's end.

Edge Case: Bad Review
Sometimes, you may end up getting a bad review or less than a 5-star rating despite your efforts to help the client. A bad review could reduce our chances of getting more jobs especially if we don’t have many reviews. But there are a couple of things that you can do to mitigate the risks.

Talk to the Client
Try to gauge what went wrong
See if the issue can be fixed
Refund
Full refund. Some platforms would remove the review if you give a full refund.
Partial refund. The client may be willing to remove the review if you give a partial refund.
Contact the platform to explain your case.
Move on. Sometimes the client may be justified or neither the platform nor the client may be willing to edit or remove the review. It’s ok to accept it and move on. If your new client asks you about the bad review and they find your explanation within reason, they might be ok to try you out.


Client: “It’s been absolutely great working with you the last three months. Unfortunately, I lost my job due to COVID and can longer fund side-projects like these. I would request to stop the development for now. Also, I am unable to immediately make the remaining payment of $1500 that I owe you but I will pay as the funds become available. As you know, I have always been prompt in making the payments through the platform so I’d really thank you for your patience while I try to figure out the finances at my end as well as get another job as soon as possible”.

How would you handle a situation like that? List down what are your options and which one would you pick out of those. Please do mention why you chose a particular option.

Enter your response here, there's no right or wrong answer


Mentioned below is one way to deal with the situation. Your response may be different, which is OK. See if your response missed any of the perspectives mentioned in the response below.



Solution
It seems like the client is in genuine trouble and has been making prompt payments in the past. The available options seem to be as follows:

Acknowledge client’s message and wait for them to pay.
Immediately raise it as an issue with the platform.
Give a heads up to the platform but do not mark it as an issue to be resolved for now.


Since there seem to be a good relationship established with the client and the payments have also been coming on time, it's fair to give benefit of doubt to the client.

At start, I would go with option (1) but will gently ask the client, a timeline, for when they expect the funds to come in (instead of having an indefinite timeline). The client may not be able to commit to one but it will help them think through a plan.
If the payment does not come in for considerable amount of time (example: 1 month, which is a considerable period of time to look for a job or get some visibility to the timeline), nudge the client again for an expected timeline. If the client does not commit to a timeline, gently send a note to the platform (i.e option (3)) giving them a heads up.
If the client does not pay for an even longer duration (for example, another month) or stops responding, go with option (2) and raise it as an issue with the platform to resolve it.
Note: The timelines mentioned above are indicative and may depend from case to case. Please see what makes most sense considering your relationship with the client, guidelines of the platform and your own cash flow situation.
