### Managing User Accounts

User management allows administrators to manage resources such as create, modify, and delete user accounts based on the roles and requirements of the employees to maintain data security.

In this reading, you'll be able to define user accounts and describe how to manage them.
**User accounts**

A user account in the Windows Server Essentials is important for accessing information, managing files, and settings. User can access their account from any location and device with appropriate permissions.
User accounts are of two types:

- Standard for basic tasks
- Administrator for network control

**Manage user accounts**

To manage the user accounts, you should have a system administrator role. This role allows you to add, modify, delete, or copy user accounts.

**Adding a user account**

Adding a user account helps the user log on to the network and access network resources, such as shared folders and files. 'Add a User Account Wizard' helps to complete the following tasks. Such as:

- Create a username and assign a password
- Assign administrator or standard user rights
- Identify the user's access to the shared folders
- Assign the user to groups
- Allow (or deny) the user's ability to access the network remotely
- Assign Microsoft 365 or email options if applicable

**Removing a user account**

When you delete a user account from the server, a wizard removes the selected account, preventing access to network resources. However, you can choose to delete the user's files simultaneously. If you want to suspend access temporarily, you can deactivate the account instead of deleting it.

Note: Removing a user account with the Microsoft online account will delete the online account and its data. However, to keep the user data in the network, an administrator can deactivate the user account.

Once you delete the user account, it will no longer appear in the user account list. If you delete the files permanently, the server will remove the user's folder and the File History Backups server folder from the user's server folder. However, by deleting the integrated email provider, the user's email account linked to the user account will also be deleted.

**Viewing user accounts**

The Users tab on the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard displays a list of network user accounts with additional details.

**Changing the display name for the user account**

The display name appears in the Name column on the Dashboard's Users page. Modifying the display name doesn't affect the user account's logon or sign-in name for that user account.
Deactivating a user account

An administrator can temporarily deactivate the user account to suspend the server access. The assigned user can't access the account for network resources until it gets reactivated. If the user account is a Microsoft online account, the online account also gets deactivated.

The Microsoft Online Services stores the user data. However, deactivating a user account changes its status to Inactive.

If the user account is linked with the email provider, an administrator can deactivate the associated email account.

**Activating an inactive user account**

Activating a user account allows users to log in and access permitted network resources like shared folders and the Remote Web Access site. An administrator can only activate a deactivated user account. However, once you permanently delete the user account from the server, you cannot activate it again.

Once a user account is activated, it shows the status as Active with restored access rights. If the user account is linked with the email provider, an administrator can activate the associated email account.

**Managing user accounts using the Dashboard**

Windows Server Essentials enables the execution of typical administrative functions through the Windows Server Essentials Dashboard. The Dashboard's Users page consists of two tabs: Users and Users Groups.

Let's look at the fields available in the Users tab.

- The user accounts list consists of:
  - User's name
  - Logon name
  - Anywhere Access permission status (Allowed/Not allowed)
  - File History management status (Managed/Not managed)
  - Access level (Standard user/Administrator)
  - Account status (Active/Inactive/Incomplete)
  - Display of Microsoft online account if integrated with Microsoft 365 or Windows Intune
- A pane will display additional details for the selected user account.
- A tasks pane describes the user account tasks available from the Users tab. Some user account-specific tasks are only visible when an administrator selects a user account in the list. This pane will display:
- Administrative tasks such as viewing and removing user accounts and changing passwords
  - Modifying settings for all user accounts in the network in one go

Of course. Here is the summary for "What is Active Directory?" without the reference links.
