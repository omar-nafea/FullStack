# Windows Security

## Active Directory Accounts and Security Considerations

### **What is Active Directory?**

**Active Directory (AD)** is a comprehensive organizational tool within Windows Server environments that functions like a digital directory for a company's network. It systematically manages data related to all network resources and users, including devices and data elements. This organized structure allows network administrators to establish access rules, ensuring employees have the appropriate level of access for their roles while safeguarding sensitive data. In essence, AD serves as the central authority in a Windows network, managing identities and relationships to maintain smooth and secure operations.

### **Active Directory Domains**

An **Active Directory Domain** is a framework for organizing and managing a network's resources, such as user accounts, computers, and security policies. It provides a centralized location for network administration and security. All users and devices within a domain are subject to its specific security policies and permissions, which are managed and enforced by one or more **domain controllers**. This structure simplifies tasks like adding new users or computers to the network, assigning access rights, and ensuring security measures are applied consistently.

### **The Role of a Domain Admin**

A **Domain Admin** account holds significant authority and control within an Active Directory domain, essentially functioning as a "master key." Network administrators use this account to perform critical tasks, including:

- Creating and managing user accounts.
- Setting up and enforcing security policies across the network.
- Installing or upgrading software on multiple devices.

Due to its extensive access and power, it is crucial for administrators to implement stringent security measures to protect the Domain Admin account from unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

### **User Accounts in a Windows Server Environment**

User accounts are unique identifiers that are crucial for managing system access for individuals. They establish and authenticate a user's identity on the network, typically through a username and password, which then governs their access to resources and allows for monitoring their activities.

Windows Server operating systems include several **default local accounts** upon installation, and organizations can also create custom user accounts to meet their specific needs.

#### **Types of Default Local Accounts**

- **Administrator Account**: This account has full control over domain controllers and the authority to manage all resources across the entire domain. Its responsibilities include creating, editing, and removing user accounts and establishing policies. For security, this account cannot be deleted or locked out, but it can be disabled or renamed.
- **Guest Account**: Intended for temporary user access, this account is highly restricted with minimal permissions. It is disabled by default to minimize security risks.
- **KRBTGT (Kerberos Ticket-Granting Ticket) Account**: This is a special, built-in account used internally by domain controllers to manage Kerberos authentication. It is responsible for issuing the tickets that grant users access to resources within the domain.
- **HelpAssistant Account**: This specialized account is installed when a remote assistance session is initiated. It is used by IT support teams to gain temporary, secure access to a user's system for troubleshooting or maintenance, with a limited scope of permissions to avoid unnecessary access to sensitive areas.

#### **Key Functions of Local Accounts**

Default local accounts serve three key functions within a domain:

1.  **Authentication**: They verify a user's identity using unique credentials like a username and password.
2.  **Authorization**: Once a user is authenticated, these accounts determine their access rights to various network and domain resources.
3.  **Monitoring and Recording**: They play a significant role in tracking activities conducted by users, which enables an effective audit trail of their actions.

# **Authentication Methods**

Authentication plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information and granting access to authorized users. There are various authentication methods, including RADIUS, TACACS, Kerberos, and Single Sign-On (SSO).

### **Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS)**

RADIUS is a widely used network protocol for centralized authentication, permission, and accounting. It enables remote access servers to communicate with a central RADIUS server, which stores user credentials and verifies the user's identity before granting access. This protocol is commonly used in dial-up and virtual private network (VPN) connections to ensure secure remote access.

### **Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)**

TACACS is another authentication method used in network security that helps with separate authentication, permission, and accounting processes. TACACS+ is an updated version that provides more robust security measures like encryption and extended permission options. TACACS is often used to manage access to network devices like routers and switches, ensuring only authorized administrators can configure them.

### **Kerberos**

Kerberos is a robust network authentication protocol that provides secure authentication across untrusted networks. It uses symmetric key cryptography to authenticate clients and servers, preventing eavesdropping and unauthorized access. The Kerberos architecture consists of several parts, including the Key Distribution Center (KDC), Authentication Server (AS), Ticket-Granting Service (TGS), and Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT). Kerberos is commonly used in environments like Windows Active Directory.

### **Single Sign-On (SSO)**

SSO is a user authentication method that uses a single set of log-on credentials to access various applications and platforms. In a Windows environment, Kerberos is often employed for SSO. When a user logs in to their workstation, they receive a Kerberos ticket, which they can use to access various resources without re-entering their credentials. SSO with Kerberos improves user experience and reduces the need to manage multiple passwords while maintaining strong security.

# **Kerberos and Active Directory**

By integrating Kerberos with Active Directory, organizations can achieve seamless authentication across their Windows-based systems and services. This integration simplifies the management of user accounts, ensures consistent security policies, and enables SSO capabilities. Users can log in once and access various resources within the Active Drectory domain without repeatedly entering their credentials.

Active Directory also offers additional security features such as Group Policy, which lets administrators enforce password policies, account lockouts, and other security configurations. It provides a comprehensive framework for managing authentication, permission, and access control.

---

### **Summary**

- **RADIUS** enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server for user authentication.
- **TACACS** helps separate authentication, permission, and accounting processes.
- **Kerberos** is a robust network protocol that provides secure authentication across untrusted networks.
- **SSO** is a user authentication method using a single set of credentials to access various applications.
- Integrating **Kerberos with Active Directory** simplifies user account management, ensures consistent security policies, and enables SSO.

## Windows sercurity settings

### **User Account Control (UAC)**

User Account Control (UAC) is a security feature that serves as a crucial layer of defense against malware and unauthorized changes to the Windows operating system. It helps maintain system integrity by making users aware of potentially risky actions through prompts, ensuring they are actively involved in security decisions.

There are two main types of UAC prompts:

- **Consent Prompt**: This prompt appears when an action requires administrative privileges, such as installing software or changing system settings. It asks the user for permission to proceed.
- **Credential Prompt**: This prompt appears when a standard user attempts an action that requires administrative privileges. It requests the username and password of an administrator account to continue, ensuring that only authorized individuals can make critical changes to the system.

### **BitLocker Drive Encryption**

BitLocker provides data protection by encrypting entire system or data drives. It converts the data into unreadable ciphertext, making it inaccessible to anyone without the correct decryption key, even if the drive is lost or stolen.

BitLocker supports several authentication methods, including:

- Passwords and PINs
- Smart cards
- Automatic unlocking through a **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**, which is a specialized microchip that securely stores cryptographic keys.

BitLocker can also be integrated into Active Directory, which allows for centralized management and storage of recovery keys.

#### **BitLocker To Go**

BitLocker To Go extends the encryption functionality of BitLocker to removable storage devices like USB drives and external hard drives. It encrypts the data on these devices using strong algorithms, ensuring the information remains secure even if the device is lost, stolen, or shared.

### **Encrypting File System (EFS)**

The Encrypting File System (EFS) is a feature that transparently encrypts individual files and folders on NTFS volumes to protect sensitive information.

Key features of EFS include:

- **Transparent Operation**: Once a file is encrypted, the encryption and decryption processes happen automatically in the background when an authorized user accesses it.
- **File-Level Encryption**: EFS operates at the file level, giving you the flexibility to encrypt specific files or folders based on their sensitivity.
- **NTFS Integration**: It integrates directly with the NTFS file system and is compatible with its features and permissions. Encryption can be applied to files stored locally or on shared network folders.
- **User-Account Based Security**: EFS uses Windows user accounts and their associated encryption keys to control access. This ensures that only users with the correct credentials and keys can decrypt and view the encrypted data.

## **User Accounts and Groups**

User accounts and groups are fundamental components for security within Windows operating systems. They provide the mechanism to control who can authenticate to the system and what resources they can access, ensuring that access is limited to authorized individuals.

- **Access Control**: User accounts are used to authenticate individuals and manage their access to files, folders, applications, and network services. By assigning specific permissions based on a user's role, administrators can enforce the **principle of least privilege**, which states that users should only be granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Group Management**: To simplify administration, users can be organized into groups based on their roles or departments. Permissions can then be assigned to the group as a whole, rather than to each individual user.
- **Centralized Management**: In a network environment, **Active Directory** allows administrators to centrally manage all user accounts and groups. This includes creating, modifying, and removing accounts, setting password policies, and controlling access to network resources from a single location.
- **Auditing and Accountability**: User accounts create an audit trail of user actions, which is vital for identifying potential security breaches and maintaining accountability.

### **Administrator vs. Standard User**

The Windows operating system has two primary types of user accounts, and the main difference between them lies in their level of permissions.

- **Standard User**: This is the default account type for regular day-to-day activities. It has limited privileges and cannot make system-wide changes, install software for all users, or modify critical system settings.
- **Administrator Account**: This account has elevated privileges, granting it broad access to all system files, settings, and administrative functions. An administrator can install software, change any system setting, and perform tasks that standard users are restricted from doing.

As a best practice, it is recommended to use a standard user account for daily tasks and only use an administrator account when necessary. This minimizes the risk of accidental system changes or damage from malicious software.

### **Types of Login Accounts**

Windows provides three main types of accounts for logging in:

1.  **Local Account**: This account is specific to a single Windows device and is not connected to any online service. It's typically used on personal computers that are not part of a larger network.
2.  **Microsoft Account**: This is an online account that connects a user to various Microsoft services like Outlook.com, OneDrive, and the Microsoft Store. Using a Microsoft account allows users to synchronize their settings, files, and preferences across multiple Windows devices.
3.  **Domain Account**: This account is used in a network environment managed by a Windows Server domain controller. It provides users with access to shared network resources like files and printers and allows for centralized management of user accounts and security policies across an organization.

### **NTFS vs. Share Permissions**

Windows uses two distinct sets of permissions to control access to files and folders: NTFS permissions and share permissions.

- **NTFS Permissions**: These permissions are applied directly to files and folders on a hard drive formatted with the New Technology File System (NTFS). They are highly granular, with access levels such as Read, Write, Change, and Full Control. NTFS permissions affect users who access the files both locally on the machine and over the network.
- **Share Permissions**: These permissions apply only when a folder is shared over a network. They are less granular than NTFS permissions, offering only three levels of access: Read, Change, and Full Control. Share permissions govern access _only_ for users connecting to the shared folder over the network; they do not affect users accessing the files locally.

When managing file access, it is crucial to consider both sets of permissions, as they work together to determine a user's effective permissions when accessing a resource over the network.

## Antimalware Tools and Microsoft Firewall Configuration

### **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**

Microsoft Defender Antivirus is a built-in security solution provided by Microsoft for Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. It offers robust and continuous protection against a variety of software threats, including viruses, malware, and spyware.

- **Real-Time Protection**: Defender actively tracks your system in real-time by scanning files, emails, applications, and other data to detect and eliminate potential threats before they can cause harm.
- **Automatic Updates**: To protect against emerging threats, it automatically updates itself with the latest virus definitions and security intelligence from Microsoft.

- **Centralized Management**: It is tightly integrated with the Windows Security Center, providing a single interface to manage various security features like firewall settings, device security, and parental controls.

### **General Antivirus and Anti-malware Software**

While Microsoft Defender provides a solid foundation, it is recommended to install other reputable antivirus and anti-malware software for additional layers of defense against evolving threats. However, you should avoid installing multiple antivirus programs simultaneously, as they can conflict and degrade system performance.

Key aspects of these tools include:

- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Modern anti-malware software uses advanced techniques beyond traditional signature-based detection. It identifies malicious behavior patterns, such as unauthorized access attempts or suspicious network communications.
- **Regular Updates**: It is crucial to keep your security software current. Vendors constantly release updates with new virus definitions and detection algorithms to combat the evolving threat landscape.
- **User Responsibility**: No security software is 100% foolproof. Practicing safe computing habits—like being cautious with downloads and email attachments, avoiding suspicious websites, and keeping your operating system and applications updated—is essential.

### **Windows Firewall**

Software firewalls, like the built-in Windows Firewall, protect your computer by tracking and controlling network communication. The firewall analyzes incoming and outgoing network traffic and compares it against a set of rules to determine whether to allow or block a connection.

Key configuration features include:

- **Notifications**: You can configure the firewall to receive alerts when it blocks a new application, keeping you informed about potential unauthorized access attempts.
- **Exceptions**: You can create exceptions to the default blocking rules for specific applications, port numbers, or common services to ensure necessary network connections are allowed.
- **Custom Rules**: For maximum control, you can create custom rules that specify program paths, port ranges, and specific IP addresses, allowing you to fine-tune the firewall's behavior.

### **Social Engineering and End-User Education**

Social engineering attacks aim to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Common techniques include phishing emails, fake websites, and deceptive phone calls that exploit human psychology rather than system vulnerabilities.

- **Limitations of Tools**: Technical defenses like antivirus and firewalls may not be effective against these attacks.
- **Importance of Education**: Combating these threats requires focusing on end-user education and awareness.
- **Training Methods**:
  - **Anti-Phishing Training**: This should be an ongoing process to teach users how to recognize suspicious emails, links, and other common phishing tactics.
  - **Simulated Phishing Tests**: Regularly conducting simulated phishing attacks helps assess user awareness and identify areas where more training is needed.
  - **Continuous Reinforcement**: Training programs should be regularly updated to address new social engineering techniques, and security best practices should be reinforced through posters, message boards, and intranet pages.

## Overview of Patching

### **Patches vs. Updates**

Patches and updates are essential components of software maintenance that are crucial for security and a smooth user experience.

- **Patches** are fixes designed to target specific bugs or security vulnerabilities discovered after a software application's initial release. They ensure the software continues to function correctly and protect it against security threats.
- **Updates** are broader in scope. They may contain patches for bugs and security issues, but they also often introduce new features or enhancements that improve the software's performance and usability.

### **The Importance of Patches and Updates**

Applying patches and updates is critical for several reasons:

- **Security**: They address security gaps and act as a critical line of defense against ever-evolving cyberthreats. For businesses, this is essential for securing sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
- **Functionality**: Patches fix bugs discovered after release, ensuring the software remains stable and functional.
- **Enhancement**: Updates often improve the software's performance and user experience, making it more efficient and enjoyable to use.
- **Compatibility and Longevity**: Updates help ensure that software remains compatible with new and emerging technologies, adapting to evolving user needs and extending the software's lifespan.

### **Frequency of Application**

The frequency for applying patches and updates varies depending on the software and the type of update.

- **Critical Security Patches**: For software used in business or for handling sensitive information, security patches should be applied as soon as they are released. Delaying these updates can leave systems vulnerable to attack.
- **Non-Critical Updates**: Updates that offer new features or minor improvements can be scheduled for more convenient times to avoid disrupting workflow. However, it is important not to postpone them for too long, as they often include security fixes that contribute to overall system stability.
- **Regular Schedule**: Establishing a regular maintenance schedule (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) is a good practice to ensure all software remains up-to-date.

### **Patch Management Best Practices**

**Patch management** is the systematic process of identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying software patches. It ensures that applications and systems remain current with the latest security fixes, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

Effective patch management involves several best practices:

- **Develop a Clear Policy**: Create an organizational policy that outlines the procedures for applying patches and updates.
- **Prioritize Patches**: Identify and prioritize critical patches that address security vulnerabilities and apply them immediately.
- **Thorough Testing**: Ensure all patches are tested thoroughly in a controlled environment to prevent conflicts or issues with existing software.
- **Have a Contingency Plan**: Prepare a plan in case a patch deployment encounters unexpected problems.
- **Automate the Process**: Use automated patch management tools and software. These tools simplify the process by handling patch detection and deployment, reducing manual workload and the risk of human error. They can also schedule updates during off-peak hours to minimize disruption and provide detailed reports on deployment status.
- **Monitor for Threats**: Periodically monitor for new patches and emerging threats to adjust schedules and priorities accordingly.

## Overview of Microsoft Update

### **What is Microsoft Update?**

Microsoft Update is a web-based extension designed to enhance a computer's performance and security by keeping it up-to-date. It serves as a comprehensive platform that integrates updates for Windows and Office, as well as patches for other Microsoft products and third-party hardware drivers. The platform receives frequent updates, ensuring users have access to the latest fixes and improvements necessary for optimal performance.

### **Methods for Conducting Updates**

There are two primary methods for conducting Microsoft updates: automatic updates and admin-managed updates.

#### **Automatic Updates**

This is a built-in feature in Windows that streamlines the process of keeping a system secure and performing well. It is ideal for personal computers.

- **Convenience**: It eliminates the need to manually check for updates and uses a taskbar notification to alert you when updates are available.
- **Automatic Downloads**: The system automatically identifies and downloads updates directly from Windows Update whenever there is an internet connection.
- **Flexibility**: Users can control when updates are installed. You can choose a specific schedule or receive notifications that allow downloads to occur in the background without disrupting your work.

#### **Admin Management**

For large organizations that need more control over the update process, administrators can manage updates manually.

- **Centralized Downloads**: System administrators can download updates from the Microsoft Download Center or the Windows Update Catalog, which is useful for managing updates across multiple computers.
- **Controlled Deployment**: This method requires that organizations rigorously evaluate and test updates in controlled environments before deploying them widely across the network.

### **Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)**

For organizations needing robust control, Microsoft offers tools like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). WSUS automates the distribution of updates released through Microsoft Update to all computers within a corporate environment.

- **Administrator Control**: WSUS gives administrators complete control over the deployment and timing of updates. This allows for thorough testing and evaluation before a widespread rollout, which minimizes disruption to business operations.
- **How It Works**: Updates are managed through a dedicated console. A WSUS server can act as an "upstream server," distributing updates to other WSUS servers within the organization. For this to function, at least one WSUS server on the network must have access to Microsoft Update to download the latest update data.

### **Best Practices for a Smooth Update Experience**

To ensure your Windows system is updated smoothly and successfully, consider the following best practices:

- **Review Updates**: Before installation, read the update summaries to understand their purpose and importance.
- **Create a Restore Point**: Always create a system restore point before applying new updates. This allows you to revert your system to a previous state if an update causes issues.
- **Check Drivers**: While Windows Update handles some drivers, you should regularly check for updates for critical hardware components manually.
- **Use the Troubleshooter**: If you encounter problems, use the built-in Windows Update troubleshooter to automatically diagnose and fix common issues.
- **Review Update History**: Periodically check the list of installed updates to identify and address any that may be causing problems.
- **Understand Update Channels**: Be aware of the different Windows Update channels available, as they cater to various user needs and risk tolerances.
- **Read Release Notes**: Regularly check Microsoft's official release notes for information about known issues or potential impacts of updates.
- **Maintain a Balanced Approach**: Consider delaying major feature updates on non-critical systems until they have been thoroughly tested by a broader user base. However, **always apply critical security updates promptly** to maintain a secure system.

## **What is Kerberos?**

Kerberos is a secure network authentication protocol, originally developed at MIT, that allows for the secure exchange of service requests over insecure networks like the internet. It uses cryptographic techniques and a trusted third-party mediator to ensure the authentication of both client-server interactions and user identities. Kerberos is now open-sourced and plays a vital role in the online security of various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, and Linux.

The core of the Kerberos system is the **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**, which handles two essential operations:

1.  **User Authentication**: It verifies the user's identity when they attempt to access a service.
2.  **Ticket Issuance**: After successful authentication, it issues two encrypted tickets—one for the user and one for the service—that act as temporary credentials.

Kerberos leverages **symmetric-key cryptography**, using a shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt information, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the data.

### **Components of the Kerberos Protocol**

The standard Kerberos protocol consists of several main elements:

- **Client**: The user or machine initiating a request for a service.
- **Hosting Server**: The server that provides the requested service to the user.
- **Authentication Server (AS)**: The component that authenticates the client and issues a **Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT)**.
- **Ticket Granting Server (TGS)**: An application server that issues tickets for accessing specific services.
- **Key Distribution Center (KDC)**: A combined system that includes both the AS and the TGS. It is central to the protocol's function.

The protocol relies on three secret keys: the client/user hash, the TGS secret key, and the service server secret key.

### **The Kerberos Authentication Flow**

The Kerberos protocol involves a multi-step process to securely authenticate a user and grant access to a service:

1.  **Requesting a TGT**: The client initiates the process by requesting a Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Authentication Server (AS). The AS validates the user's credentials and, if successful, creates an encrypted session key (SK1) and the TGT. The TGT is encrypted with the TGS's secret key.
2.  **Receiving the TGT**: The client receives the TGT and the encrypted session key (SK1). The client uses its own secret key to decrypt SK1.
3.  **Requesting a Service Ticket**: The client then presents the TGT and a new authenticator to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) to request a service ticket for a specific server.
4.  **Verifying the TGT**: The TGS decrypts the TGT with its secret key to extract SK1 and verifies the authenticator and the TGT's validity (e.g., via timestamp).
5.  **Issuing the Service Ticket**: If authentication is successful, the TGS generates a new session key (SK2) for secure communication between the client and the service server. It then creates a service ticket containing the client's information and SK2, encrypts it with the service server's secret key, and sends it to the client.
6.  **Accessing the Service**: The client uses SK1 to decrypt the message from the TGS, extracting SK2. It then constructs a new authenticator, encrypts it with SK2, and sends it along with the service ticket to the target server.
7.  **Mutual Authentication**: The target server uses its secret key to decrypt the service ticket and extract SK2. It then decrypts the authenticator and verifies the client's identity. Upon successful validation, the server sends a confirmation message back to the client, completing the mutual authentication process.

### **Benefits of Kerberos in Domain-Based Systems**

In a domain-based environment like Windows Active Directory, the KDC acts as a trusted third party that integrates with security services on the domain controller. This provides several key benefits:

- **Delegated Authentication**: It allows services to access resources on behalf of clients, which is useful in diverse environments.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: It simplifies access to resources by eliminating the need for users to repeatedly enter their credentials.
- **Interoperability**: Microsoft's version of Kerberos (Kerberos V5) adheres to IETF standards, allowing it to work well with other networks that also use Kerberos.
- **Efficiency**: Compared to older methods, Kerberos uses renewable session tickets, which reduces the authentication load on servers.
- **Mutual Authentication**: It enhances network security by allowing both the client and the server to securely validate each other's identity.

## Overview of Windows Auditing

### **What is Security Auditing?**

Security auditing is the process of conducting regular security checks on a computer system or network. Its primary purpose is to thoroughly assess a system's security measures to uncover vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats. By identifying these issues, organizations can implement solutions to improve security and protect against cyberattacks or unauthorized access.

A **Windows security audit** is a specific function within the Windows operating system that tracks defined events. It allows administrators to monitor system activities and record security-related events based on a set of rules known as audit policies. The logs generated from these audits provide valuable insights into the system's security posture and help identify potential breaches.

### **Basic Audit Policies**

Before beginning an audit, it is important to implement comprehensive auditing policies that identify which security-related events require continuous monitoring. Key audit policies in Windows include:

- **Account Logon Events**: Tracks the details of user logins.
- **Account Management**: Monitors events related to changes in user accounts, such as password resets.
- **Directory Service Access**: Tracks access to directory services like Active Directory.
- **Logon Events**: Records when users log on to a specific system.
- **Object Access**: Involves events related to accessing or modifying specific objects, such as files and folders.
- **Policy Change**: Covers any event that results in a change to a security policy.
- **Privilege Use**: Tracks events where users exercise special privileges, such as using elevated permissions.
- **Process Tracking**: Records events for applications or system processes that have been started or stopped.
- **System Events**: Encompasses general system events, such as the computer restarting or shutting down.

### **How to Create an Effective Audit Policy**

Creating an effective audit policy requires careful planning and a deep understanding of an organization's security needs. The process can be broken down into five main steps:

1.  **Identify Critical Assets**: The first step is to identify the most important assets within the network, such as sensitive data, key systems, and critical applications.
2.  **Determine Actions and Events to Monitor**: Next, determine which specific actions and events related to those critical assets should be monitored. This involves considering factors like user access levels, types of data, and potential internal and external threats.
3.  **Develop a Structured Audit Policy**: Create a formal audit policy that aligns with the organization's security objectives. This document should outline the events to be monitored, how audit logs will be managed and reviewed, and the roles and responsibilities of the team conducting the audits.
4.  **Implement the Policy**: Put the policy into action by configuring the network's security settings to track the selected events. In a Windows environment, this is typically done using Group Policy or local security policies. It is also crucial to ensure that the audit logs are stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.
5.  **Review and Update Regularly**: Finally, the audit data must be reviewed and analyzed regularly. Audit policies are considered "live documents" and require continuous updates to adapt to changes in the network, emerging threats, and new regulatory requirements. This constant monitoring and review ensure that the auditing efforts remain effective and aligned with the overall security strategy.
