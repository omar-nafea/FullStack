```js
import React, {useContext, useState} from 'react

const ThemeContext = useContext()

export function ThemeProvider ({chlidren}) {
    const [darkTheme, setDarkTheme] = useState(true)

    function toggleTheme() {
    setDarkTheme(prevDarkTheme => !prevDarkTheme)}

    <ThemeContext.Provider value={darkTheme}>
        {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>

}
```

essentially what we're doing is we have our `themeContext.Provider` and we're passing in the value of `darkTheme` and then we're rendering the `children` and all of our information for our context is all inside of this one single component
