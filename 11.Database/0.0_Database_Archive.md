## Database Archive

**What is data?**

In basic terms, data is facts and figures about anything. For example, if data were collected on a person, then that data might include their name, age, email, and date of birth. Or the data could be facts and figures related to an online purchase. This could be the order number, description, order quantity, and date, and even the customer's email. Data is crucial for individuals as well as organizations.

Where's all this data stored? In our digital world, data is no longer stored in manual files. Instead, developers use something called databases. **A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is organized systematically**. It stores and manipulates data electronically to make it more manageable, efficient, and secure.

A database looks like data organized systematically. This organization typically looks like a spreadsheet or a table. What exactly does the term systematic mean? All data contains elements or features and attributes by which they can be identified. For example, a person can be identified by attributes like their age, height, or hair color. This data is separated and stored in what's known as entities that represent those elements.

An entity is like a table. It contains rows and columns that store data relating to a specific element. In other words, these are relational elements. They're related to one another.

Whatever the source of the data a database will typically carry out the following actions, all of which developers such as yourself must be familiar with store the data form connections or relationships between segmented areas of the data, filter the data to show relevant records, search data to return matching records and have functions to lay the data to be updated, changed and deleted as required

## How Data is related?

In the database of your online store, you could have an order table and a customer table. To locate the details of a customer's order, you will check the order number against the customer ID. In other words, the database establishes a link between the data in the tables.

In customer table, the columns are `Customer ID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Email`. In relational database terms, these are fields. Then there are several rows which contain data for each of these fields.

In relational databases, they're known as records of the table. All these fields and rows work together to store information on the customer, also known as the entity. Every row and record in the customer table is an instance of the customer entity.

What's most important is that each of customers instances or records must be uniquely identifiable. you can use a field that contains only unique values like the customer ID. This is called a primary key field. It contains unique values that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the table.

Even if two customers share the same name, they'll still have separate customer IDs. This means that your database can determine which customer is the required one.

Let's look at the order table next. Just like the customer table, the order table also has fields and records. In this table, the primary key field is the order ID. But there's also a field named customer ID with the exact same data as the customer data.

![foreign key](../0.Pics/ForeignKeyInOrderTable.png)

What is the purpose of the customer ID in this table? The Customer ID is there to help identify who it is that place the order. By adding the customer ID field to the order table, our relationship is established between the customer table and the order table. Because of this relationship, you can pull data in a meaningful way from both tables. The customer ID field in the order table is known as the foreign key field. A foreign key is a field in one table that connects to the primary key field in the original table, which in this case is the customer table. The customer ID is the primary key of the customer table, but it becomes a foreign key in the order table. This way, the relationship is established and the data in these two tables are related.

## Database Evolution

**The history**

The history of databases begins in the 1960s with the computerization of databases. Computers emerged as a more cost-effective option for organizations. It also became easier to shift data storage and databases to computers.

The chronological order of the development of databases is as follows:

- (1970s-1990s) - Flat files, hierarchical and network

- (1980s-present) - Relational

- (1990s- present) - Object-oriented, object-relational, web-enabled

Flat files

Flat files databases were used during the 1970s-1990s. This is a type of database system that stores data in a single file or table. They are basically text files, where every line contains one record and fields either have fixed lengths or are separated by commas, whitespaces and tabs. Such a file cannot contain multiple tables.

Below is an example of what a flat file database looks like. This text file stores lines of data, where each line represents a record. The fields OrderID, CustomerID and OrderDate are separated by commas

![flat files](../0.Pics/flatFiles.png)

**Hierarchical database systems**

Hierarchical database systems that were in use during the same era store data in a hierarchically arranged manner.

Think about it this way: parents can have many children, but one child can only have one parent. In other words, the database represents a one-to-many relationship: all attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.

Below is an example of how data is stored in a hierarchical database. In this case, it is data on college students who are taking different courses. A course can be assigned to only a single student, but a student can take as many courses as they want. Thus, there is a one-to-many relationship.

There are three students:

- John,

- Anil

- and Rohan

And there are four courses:

- C#,

- Perl,

- Python

- and Java.

Student and Course are the entity types. John takes C# and Anil takes both Python and Java. Rohan takes Perl.

![hierarchical](../0.Pics/Hierarchical_database.png)

**Network database systems**

Network databases were introduced by Charles Bachmann. Unlike the hierarchical database model, a network database allows multiple parent and child relationships. In other words, many-to many relationships. In network database terminology, a child record is known as a member. A member or child can be reached through more than one parent, which is called an owner.

A network database has a graph-like structure, and it allows you to represent more complex relationships among data.

Here's an example of a network database. A teacher can teach multiple courses and a course can have multiple teachers teaching it.

![Network Database](../0.Pics/Network_databases.png)

In this era, a language known as the SEQUEL query language was used to work with databases. Later on, with relational databases, this developed into SQL (Structured Query Language) which was made a standard query language to work with databases by the American National Standards Institute once relational database systems were introduced.

### Relational database system

The relational database system that was introduced in the 1980s is still the most used database system. It was invented by E. F. Codd and it’s the successor of hierarchical and network database systems. It was viewed as a major paradigm shift in database technology.

In a relational database system, data is stored in tables. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data. Each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships between data points. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID attribute called the primary key. A relational database stores and provides access to data that are related to one another using an attribute known as a foreign key.

#### What is a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table where the data points are related to each other.

Data is typically structured across multiple tables, which can be joined together via a primary key or a foreign key. These unique identifiers demonstrate the different relationships which exist between tables, and these relationships are usually illustrated through different types of data models. Analysts use SQL queries to combine different data points and summarize business performance, allowing organizations to gain insights, optimize workflows, and identify new opportunities.

For example, imagine your company maintains a database table with customer information, which contains company data at the account level. There may also be a different table, which describes all the individual transactions that align to that account. Together, these tables can provide information about the different industries that purchase a specific software product.

The columns (or fields) for the customer table might be Customer ID, Company Name, Company Address, Industry etc.; the columns for a transaction table might be Transaction Date, Customer ID, Transaction Amount, Payment Method, etc. The tables can be joined together with the common Customer ID field. You can, therefore, query the table to produce valuable reports, such as a sales reports by industry or company, which can inform messaging to prospective clients.

Relational databases are also typically associated with transactional databases, which execute commands, or transactions, collectively. A popular example that is used to illustrate this is a bank transfer. A defined amount is withdrawn from one account, and then it is deposited within another. The total amount of money is withdrawn and deposited, and this transaction cannot occur in any kind of partial sense. Transactions have specific properties. Represented by the acronym, ACID, ACID properties are defined as:

- `Atomicity`: All changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation. That is, all the changes are performed, or none of them are.

- `Consistency`: Data remains in a consistent state from state to finish, reinforcing data integrity.

- `Isolation`: The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions, and as a result, transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized.

- `Durability`: After the successful completion of a transaction, changes to data persist and are not undone, even in the event of a system failure.

**What is a relational database management system (RDBMS)**

While a relational database organizes data based off a relational data model, a relational database management system (RDBMS) is a more specific reference to the underlying database software that enables users to maintain it. These programs allow users to create, update, insert, or delete data in the system, and they provide: Data structure, Multi-user access, Privilege control, Network access.

#### Object-oriented databases

In the 1990s, object-oriented databases were introduced. This was when the object-oriented (OO) programming paradigm became popular and there was a need to represent data in a system as objects as well. Unlike relational databases, object-oriented databases work in the framework of real programming languages like Java and C++, for example.

Below is what an object-oriented database looks like. Instead of tables, there are entities or classes like Author, Book and Customer with their attributes and behaviors.

It’s possible to represent data according to OO concepts like inheritance and parent-child relationships among data. For example, an Author and Customer are both descendants of Person. Thus, a person is a generic entity that can represent both an Author and a Customer.

![OOP database](../0.Pics/OOPdatabase.png)

### NoSQL databases

Relational databases that are widely used even at present only allows to store structured data. Later on, there was a need to work more and more with unstructured data. This was when NoSQL databases came about as a response to the Internet and the need for faster speed and the processing of unstructured data.

NoSQL databases are preferred over relational databases because of their speed and flexibility in storing data. It does not store data in relations or tables that belong to a strict structure. Data can be stored in an ad-hoc manner and they allow to store and process high volumes of different kinds of data. NoSQL databases are capable of processing unstructured big data that’s generated by social media, IoT and others. Therefore, social platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google for example makes use of NoSQL databases.

These are some of the advantages of NoSQL databases:

- Higher scalability

- Distributed

- Lower costs

- A flexible schema

- Can process unstructured and semi-structured data

- Has no complex relationships

Over time there were different types of NoSQL databases that were introduced:

While relational databases structure data into a tabular format, non-relational databases do not have as rigid of a database schema. In fact, non-relational databases organize data differently based on the type of database. Irrespective of the type of non-relational database, they all aim to solve for the flexibility and scalability issues inherent in relational models which are not ideal for unstructured data formats, like text, video, and images. These types of databases include:

- `Key-value store`: This schema-less data model is organized into a dictionary of key-value pairs, where each item has a key and a value. The key could be like something similar found in a SQL database, like a shopping cart ID, while the value is an array of data, like each individual item in that user’s shopping cart. It’s commonly used for caching and storing user session information, such as shopping carts. However, it's not ideal when you need to pull multiple records at a time. Redis and Memcached are examples of open-source databases with this data model.

- `Document store`: As suggested by the name, document databases store data as documents. They can be helpful in managing semi-structured data, and data are typically stored in JSON, XML, or BSON formats. This keeps the data together when it is used in applications, reducing the amount of translation needed to use the data. Developers also gain more flexibility since data schemas do not need to match across documents (e.g. name vs. first_name). However, this can be problematic for complex transactions, leading to data corruption. Popular use cases of document databases include content management systems and user profiles. An example of a document-oriented database is MongoDB, the database component of the MEAN stack.

- `Wide-column store`: These databases store information in columns, enabling users to access only the specific columns they need without allocating additional memory on irrelevant data. This database tries to solve for the shortcomings of key-value and document stores, but since it can be a more complex system to manage, it is not recommended for use for newer teams and projects. Apache HBase and Apache Cassandra are examples of open-source, wide-column databases. Apache HBase is built on top of Hadoop Distributed Files System that provides a way of storing sparse data sets, which is commonly used in many big data applications. Apache Cassandra, on the other hand, has been designed to manage large amounts of data across multiple servers and clustering that spans multiple data centers. It’s been used for a variety of use cases, such as social networking websites and real-time data analytics.

- `Graph store`: This type of database typically houses data from a knowledge graph. Data elements are stored as nodes, edges and properties. Any object, place, or person can be a node. An edge defines the relationship between the nodes. Graph databases are used for storing and managing a network of connections between elements within the graph. Neo4j (link resides outside IBM), a graph-based database service based on Java with an open-source community edition where users can purchase licenses for online backup and high availability extensions, or pre-package licensed version with backup and extensions included.

### What is Database Management System (DBMS)

A database management system is a software application which is used for managing different databases. It helps us to create and manage database. With the help of DBMS we take care following tasks –

1. Data Security

2. Data Backup

3. Manages huge amount of data

4. Data export & import

5. Serving multiple concurrent database requests

6. Gives us a way to manage the data using programming languages.

> We cannot interact with non-relational databases using SQL.

### What is SQL?

SQL is used to interact with relational databases. We often refer relational database as SQL database.

What sort of interactions do database engineers need to establish with databases? Some of the operations you could carry it in the data might require you to create, read, update, and delete data. These operations are also known as CRUD operations.

SQL is the standard language that can be used with all databases. It's particularly useful when working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data.

A database interprets and make sense of SQL instructions with the use of a Database Management System or DBMS. The DBMS takes responsibility for transforming SQL instructions into a form that's understood by the underlying database.

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a standardised language for interacting with RDBMS (Relational Database Management System). Some of the popular relational database example are: MySQL, Oracle, mariaDB, postgreSQL etc.

2. SQL is used to perform C.R.U.D (Create, Retrieve, Update & Delete) operations on relational databases.

3. SQL can also perform administrative tasks on database such as database security, backup, user management etc.

4. We can create databases and tables using SQL.

**What is a Query**

A Query is a set of instruction given to the database management system, which tells RDBMS what information you would like to get, insert, update or delete from the database.

### Types of Structured Query Language (SQL Subsets)

In the above section, we learned what we do with the database using SQL. SQL is basically combination of four different languages, they are –

1. **DQL (Data Query Language)**

DQL is used to fetch the data from the database that already exists in the database. DQL command is: `SELECT`.

2. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**

DDL is used to define table schemas. DDL commands are: `CREATE`, `DROP` and `ALTER`.

3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**

DCL is used for user & permission management. It controls the access to the database. DCL commands are: `GRANT` and `REVOKE`.

4. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**

DML is used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database. DML commands are: INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE.

5. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**

TCL is used for transaction management tasks in the database. TCL commands are: COMMIT and ROLLBACK.

#### Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL helps you define data in your database. Before you can store data in the database.

You need to create the database and related objects like tables in which your data will be stored. For this, the DDL part of SQL has a command named `create`. Then you might need to modify already created database objects. For example, you might need to modify the structure of a table by adding a new column. You can perform this task with the DDL `alter` command. You can remove an object like a table from a database using the DDL `drop` command.

#### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manipulate data in the database, like inserting, updating or deleting data. Most crude operations fall under DML. To add data to a table, you can use the `insert` command. This command lets you specify the fields to add data to along with the values to be inserted. If you need to edit data that's already inserted into a table, just deploy the `update` command. And you can specify data to be removed by using the `delete` command.

#### Data Query Language (DQL)

To read data stored in a database, you can use data query language. DQL defines a select command to be able to retrieve data. `Select` lets you retrieve data from one or multiple tables letting you specify the data fields that you want based on preferred filter criteria.

#### Data Control Language (DCL)

using DCL commands, you control access to data stored in the database. `Grant` and `revoke` DDL commands are used to give users access privileges to data, and to revert access privileges already given to users.

### SQL syntax introduction

to create collage database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE collage;
```

you can create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student;
```

Now I need to populate the table with data. This is where I can use the data manipulation language or DML subset of SQL. To add table data, I use the insert into syntax. This inserts rows of data into a given table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(
  column_ID,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  date_of_birth,
  email,
) VALUES (
  value1,
  value2,
  value3,
);
```

![insert](../0.Pics/StudentTable.png)

But what if I need to update or modify data?. For example, let's say I've input the wrong date of birth for a student. To change this data, I can use the update syntax, which is part of the DML subset of SQL.

```sql
UPDATE Student SET date_of_birth = '2002-10-12' WHERE ID = 02;
```

To remove all data on row 3 of the table. I can instruct my SQL to remove the data of the student on row 3

```sql
DELETE FROM Student WHERE ID = 03;
```

how would you read data stored in your database tables? That's where SQL, DQL or data query language comes in. The main syntax of DQL is select.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Student WHERE ID = 01;
```

## Common SQL Commands

The objective of this reading is to teach you how to name and explain the main commands in SQL. SQL is the most widely used database query language. It is designed for retrieving and managing data in a relational database. SQL can be used to perform different types of operations in the database such as accessing data, describing data, manipulating data and setting users roles and privileges (permissions).

Here you will learn about the main commands used in SQL. At a later stage you will explore relevant examples of how to use these commands with a detailed explanation of the SQL syntax for key operations such as to create, insert, update and delete data in the database.

The SQL Commands are grouped into four categories known as DDL, DML, DCL and TCL depending on their functionality, namely the type of operation they’re used to perform.  Let’s explore these commands in greater detail.

**Data Definition Language (DDL)**

The SQL DDL category provides commands for defining, deleting and modifying tables in a database. Use the following commands in this category.

**CREATE Command**

Purpose: To create the database or tables inside the database

Syntax to create a table with three columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name1 datatype(size), column_name2 datatype(size), column_name3 datatype(size));
```

**DROP Command**

Purpose: To delete a database or a table inside the database.

Syntax to drop a table:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

**ALTER Command**

Purpose: To change the structure of the tables in the database such as changing the name of a table, adding a primary key to a table, or adding or deleting a column in a table.

1. Syntax to add a column into a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size));
```

2. Syntax to add a primary key to a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);
```

**TRUNCATE Command**

Purpose: To remove all records from a table, which will empty the table but not delete the table itself.

Syntax to truncate a table:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

**COMMENT Command**

Purpose: To add comments to explain or document SQL statements by using double dash (--) at the start of the line. Any text after the double dash will not be executed as part of the SQL statement. These comments are not there to build the database. They are only for your own use.

Syntax to COMMENT a line in SQL:

```sql
--Retrieve all data from a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

**Data Query Language (DQL)**

The SQL DQL commands provide the ability to query and retrieve data from the database.  Use the following command in this category.

**SELECT Command**

Purpose: To retrieve data from tables in the database.

Syntax to select data from a table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

## **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

The SQL DML commands provide the ability to query, delete and update data in the database.  Use the following commands in this category.

**INSERT Command**

Purpose: To add records of data into an existing table.
Syntax to insert data into three columns in a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```

**UPDATE Command**

Purpose: To modify or update data contained within a table in the database.

Syntax to update data in two columns:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```

**DELETE Command**

Purpose: To delete data from a table in the database.

Syntax to delete data:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## **Data Control Language (DCL)**

You use DCL to deal with the rights and permissions of users of a database system. You can execute SQL commands to perform different types of operations such as create and drop tables. To do this, you need to have user rights set up. This is called user privileges. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in the database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

`GRANT` Command to provide the user of the database with the privileges required to allow users to access and manipulate the database.

`REVOKE` Command to remove permissions from any user.

## **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**

The TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands. It also allows SQL statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in a database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

`COMMIT` Command to save all the work you have already done in the database.

`ROLLBACK` Command to restore a database to the last committed state.

### What are table in database

In a more conceptual or logical sense, A table is also known as an entity and an object oriented databases or OO-DB An entity is an object that is attributes that are like columns or fields in a table. So in essence a table, entity and object all refer to the same concept.

within every table or columns. Also sometimes called fields or attributes. Each column or field has a unique name and data type. For example, I have a table that contains data on employees in a company. The table organizes the data in the columns such as I. D. And roll And each column can hold different types of data like numeric or string.

![column](../0.Pics/columnsInTable.png)

A set of columns or fields. Former row in relational database terminology. A row is known as a record. So a record is a combination of columns or fields that contain data in my employee table. For example, each rose a single employee record.

![Rows](../0.Pics/rowsInTable.png)

Every column has a data type. The data type of a column defines what type of value a column can hold like integer character, date and time and so on. It's up to the developer to decide the data type for each column. And it's also a guideline for sequel around what data type to expect in each column and how to interact with the underlying data stored physically. However, data types can vary depending on the database system.

Always referred to the documentation of the relevant database system to check what data types it supports. Generally all database systems support

- string data types for storing characters and strings of characters,
- numeric data types to store exact or whole numbers and approximate numbers,
- date and time data types to store information on date and time
- binary data types to store images, files and other information.

A domain is the set of legal values that can be assigned to an attribute basically this means making sure that the values of field can hold are well defined. For example, you can only place numbers in a numerical domain and you can only place characters or strings of characters in a string domain and each of these domains must include length values and other relevant rules that define its function. Each rower record in a table is also uniquely identified by what's known as a primary key.

### Tables overview

In this reading, you’ll find out more about tables in a relational database. You’ve been introduced to the concept of a table within a database by now and you have also reviewed a few examples of tables. And you’ve gained a basic understanding of what a primary key does in a table.

The main objective of this reading is to examine tables in more depth in terms of the structure of a table, data types, primary and foreign keys and the role they play in a table, as well as table constraints.

To refresh your memory, a table is the most basic type of database object in relational databases. It is responsible for storing data in the database. Like any other table, a database table also consists of rows and columns.

Just like in a spreadsheet of data, there are rows that run horizontally. These rows represent each record. Rows in turn span multiple columns.

Columns run vertically. They are like the definition of each field. Each column has a name that describes the data that is stored in it. Examples of column names could include FirstName, LastName, ProductID, Price and so forth.

Where the row intersects with a column is where a cell is located. A cell is where you store an item of data.

**What are data types?**

Every column in a table has a data type. These data types are defined by SQL or Structured Query Language. A data type defines the type of value that can be stored in a table column.

For example, here are some of the data types that are available:

- Numeric data types such as `INT`, `TINYINT`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, `REAL`.
- Date and time data types such as `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`.
- Character and string data types such as `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`.
- Binary data types such as `BINARY`, `VARBINARY`.
- Miscellaneous data types such as:
  - Character Large Object (CLOB) for storing a large block of text in some form of text encoding.
  - Binary Large Object (BLOB) for storing a collection of binary data such as images.

Here’s an example of a table. This is the student table that stores data about a student such as:

- student ID,
- first name,
- last name,
- date of birth,
- home address,
- and faculty.

These are the table's columns.

There are also six rows within this table; one for each student. In other words, the table contains the records of six students.

Each cell in a row or record contains a piece of data such as student ID = 1, first name = Emily, last name = Williams and so on.

![studentTable](../0.Pics/StudentsTable.png)

The student ID would probably have a data type of INT, for example. First name and last name would have a data type of VARCHAR and date of birth would have a data type of DATE.

**Tables in a relational database**

In a relational database there are multiple tables representing the structure of the back end of a software system. For example, in the context of a Student Information System, the tables might include Student, Teacher, Class and Subject.

In relational database terminology a table is also known as a relation. A table row or a record is also known as a tuple. For example, the student relation above has six tuples.

Each table or relation in a database has its own schema. Schema simply means the structure. The structure includes:

- the name of the table or relation,
- its attributes,
- their names
- and data type.

**What is a primary key?**

In a table, there is a field or column that is known as a key which can uniquely identify a particular tuple (row) in a relation (table). This key is specifically known as a primary key.

For example, in the student table, the student ID allows you to uniquely identify a particular row. The other columns like first name, last name, date of birth and others could contain duplicate or repeating data for multiple students. Therefore, they can't be used to uniquely identify a given student record. So, the student ID is the primary key of the student table.

In some cases, the primary key can comprise more than one column or field. This happens when a single column cannot make a record in a table uniquely identifiable. For example, in the table below, the EMP_ID values aren’t unique, so the column is not unique by itself. Thus, this column alone cannot be used as the primary key of this table. However, the EMP_ID and DEPT_ID columns together can make a record unique. Therefore, the primary key of this table is EMP_ID and DEPT_ID. This is also known as a composite primary key.

![primary_key](../0.Pics/PrimaryKeyInTable.png)

**What is a foreign key?**

Tables in a database do not stay isolated from each other. They need to have relationships between them. Tables are linked with one another through a key column (the primary key) of one table that’s also present in the related table as a foreign key. For example, the student table and the department table are linked via the student ID which is the primary key of the student table that’s also present in the Department table as a foreign key.

![foreign_key](../0.Pics/foreignKeyInTable.png)

**Integrity constraints**

Every table in a database should abide by rules or constraints. These are known as integrity constraints.

There are three main integrity constraints:

1. Key constraints

2. Domain constraints

3. Referential integrity constraints

**What are key constraints?**

In every table there should be one or more columns or fields that can be used to fetch data from tables. In other words, a primary key. The key constraint specifies that there should be a column, or columns, in a table that can be used to fetch data for any row. This key attribute or primary key should never be NULL or the same for two different rows of data. For example, in the student table I can use the student ID to fetch data for each of the students. No value of student ID is null, and it is unique for every row, hence it can be the key attribute.

**What are domain constraints?**

Domain constraints refer to the rules defined for the values that can be stored for a certain column. For instance, you cannot store the home address of a student in the first name column. Similarly, a contact number cannot exceed ten digits.

**What are referential integrity constraints?**

When a table is related to another table via a foreign key column, then the referenced column value must exist in the other table. This means, according to the student and department examples, that values should exist in the student ID column in the student table because the two tables are related via the student ID column.

In this reading, you learned more about tables in a relational database as you explored the table in terms of its structure, data types, constraints, and the role of primary and foreign keys.

## Database structure overview

In this reading, you’ll find out more about the basic database structure. You’ve been introduced to what a table is in a database, the basic structure of a table, data types, what primary and foreign keys are and the roles they play in a table. You also learned about table constraints.

The main objective of this reading is to cover the basic structure of a database. In other words, you will learn more about tables, fields (or attributes), records, keys and table relationships.

**What is database structure?**

Database structure refers to how data is arranged in a database. Within a database, related data are grouped into tables, each of which consists of rows (also called tuples) and columns, like in a spreadsheet.

The structure of a database consists of a set of key components. These include:

- Tables or entities, where the data is stored.

- Attributes which are details about the table or entity. In other words, attributes describe the table.

- Fields, which are columns used to capture attributes.

- A record, which is one row of details about a table or entity.

- And the primary key, which is a unique value for an entity.

This image shows the basic structural elements of a database table.

**Table**

A table contains all the fields, attributes and records for a type of entity. A database will most probably contain more than one table.

**Fields**

Column headings are known as fields. Each field contains a different attribute. For every table, a unit of data is entered into each field. It’s also known as a column value. Each column has a data type. For example, the “agent_name” column has a data type of text, and the “commission” column has a numeric data type.
Column value or unit of data

Each individual piece of data entered into a column is a unit of data. These units are also called data elements or column values.

**Records**

A record consists of a collection of data for each entity. It’s also known as a row in the table.

**Data types**

To keep the data consistent from one record to the next, an appropriate data type is assigned to each column. The data type of a column determines what type of data can be stored in each column.

Data types are also a way of classifying data values or column values. Different kinds of data values or column values require different amounts of memory to store them. Different operations can be performed on those column values based on their datatypes.

### Logical database structure

The logical structure of a database is represented using a diagram known as the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). It is a visual representation of how the database will be implemented into tables during physical database design, using a Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL or Oracle, for example.

A part of the logical database structure is how relationships are established between entities. These relationships are established between the instances of the entities. Accordingly, there can be three ways in which entity instances can be related to each other:

- One-to-one relationships
- One-to-many relationships
- Many-to-many relationships

This is also known as cardinality of relationships. The logical database structure which is represented using an ERD also depicts these relationships.

Here’s an example of an ERD that has all these elements.

**Physical database structure**

In the physical database structure, where entities are implemented as tables, the relationships are established using a field known as a foreign key. A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to a common field in another table (usually the primary key).

Let’s take the example of a database that contains two tables: student and department. The student table has a primary key of “Stud_id”, which is also present in the Department table as a foreign key. Therefore, the two tables are related to each other via the “Stud_id” field.

In this reading, you learned more about the basic database structure including tables, fields or attributes, records, keys and relationships between tables.

#### Types of keys in a database table

The relational database model is based on two main concepts, entities which are defined as tables and relations that connect to related tables.

Each table has relevant columns where each column represents an attribute of the table entity.

![tables](../0.Pics/3tables.png)

The league table keeps track of each team's position in the league, their name and the state they represent. The team's table tracks the team name, the team captain and the team coach, and the points table records the team's position in the league, the team's name and how many points the team has this season.

Notice that the team's table includes team name, which also belongs to the league table. These attributes could be of a simple attribute type that can hold a single value

![staff_table](../0.Pics/staff_table.png)

for example, in a table of staff members in a college, each staff name attribute as a single value in each row. Or they could also have a multi value attribute that can have multiple values like a list of subjects taught. However multi value attributes should be avoided in relational database design.

Let's use the example of the staff table to explore some examples of attribute keys. Let's begin with the key attribute. This is a value used to uniquely identify an individual record of data in a table. For example in the staff table the key attribute is staff_ID This attribute has unique value in each row of the table so it's the perfect way to uniquely identify each record of data

**candidate key attributes**

This is any attribute that contains a unique value in each row of the table. In the case of the staff table, both the staff I. D. And contact numbers are examples of candidate keys. Each has a new unique value in each role. The other columns can contain repeated information so they're designated as non key attributes.

**A composite key**

is a key that is composed of two or more attributes to form a unique value in each new role in the staff table. An example of a composite key is a combination of the staff name and staff title, assuming that there isn't another instance of the same combination elsewhere on the table. A composite key is usually considered when a single attribute key can't be identified.

**An alternate key**

also known as the secondary key is a candidate key that was not selected to be the primary key. Just like a primary key. It's a column that contains a unique value in each field. For the staff table, the contact number is a secondary key on each roll

**The foreign key**

is an attribute on the table that references a unique key in another table. Typically a foreign key reference is the primary key of another table. For example, the staff I. D. Might also be a foreign key in one or more tables within the college database.
